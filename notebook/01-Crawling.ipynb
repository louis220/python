      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Standing on the threshold of my eightieth year, stumbling badly,\r\n",
      "moreover, through the mutiny, well justified, of a pair of worn-out\r\n",
      "eyes, I, a veteran maker of books, must look forward to the closing of\r\n",
      "an over-long series.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I retain in my memory certain films, which record impressions of long\r\n",
      "ago. Can I not possibly develop and present these film records for a\r\n",
      "moving picture of the men and events of an eventful period?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We old story-tellers do our talking under a heavy handicap. Homer,\r\n",
      "long ago, found us garrulous, and compared us to cicadas chirping\r\n",
      "unprofitably in the city-gate. In the modern time, too, Dr. Holmes,\r\n",
      "ensconced in smug youth, could \"sit and grin\" at one of our kind as he\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  \"Totters o'er the ground\r\n",
      "  With his cane.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thought\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  \"His breeches and all that\r\n",
      "  Were so queer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The \"all that\" is significant. To the callow young doctor, men of our\r\n",
      "kind were throughout queered, and so, too, think the spruce and jaunty\r\n",
      "company who are shouldering us so fast out of the front place. In\r\n",
      "their thought we are more than depositors of last leaves, in fact we\r\n",
      "are last leaves ourselves, capable in the green possibly of a pleasant\r\n",
      "murmur, but in the dry with no voice but a rattle prophetic of winter.\r\n",
      "I hope Dr. Holmes lived to repent his grin. At any rate he lived to\r\n",
      "refute the notion that youthful fire and white hairs exclude each\r\n",
      "other. If we must totter, what ground we have to totter over, with\r\n",
      "two generations and more behind us! The ground is ours. We only have\r\n",
      "looked into the faces of the great actors, and have taken part in the\r\n",
      "epoch-making events. As I unroll my panorama I may totter, but I hope\r\n",
      "I shall not dodder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Retiring, as I must soon do from my somewhat Satanic activity, from\r\n",
      "\"going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it,\" I can\r\n",
      "claim, like my ill-reputed exemplar, to have encountered some patient\r\n",
      "Jobs, servants of the Lord, but more who were impatient, yet not the\r\n",
      "less the Lord's servants, and the outward semblance of these I try to\r\n",
      "present. My pictures have to some extent been exhibited before, in\r\n",

      "I came to consciousness in the then small town of Buffalo in western\r\n",

      "goods were conveyed from Massachusetts for the most part by the Erie\r\n",

      "distinct vision, the small boy's point of view being not much above\r\n",
      "the sidewalk, of the striding legs in long processions, of wide-open,\r\n",
      "clamorous mouths above, and over all of the flutter of tassels and\r\n",
      "banners. Then began my knowledge of log-cabins, coon-skins, and of\r\n",
      "the name hard cider, the thump of drums, the crash of brass-bands,\r\n",
      "cockades, and torch-lights. My powers as a singer, always modest,\r\n",

      "obtrudes too obstinately upon my tympanum, though much fine harmony\r\n",
      "heard since in cathedrals and the high shrines of music is quite\r\n",
      "powerless now to make that organ vibrate. Four years later, my\r\n",
      "emerging voice did better justice to \"Harry Clay of Old Kentucky,\" and\r\n",
      "my early teens found me in an environment that quickened prematurely\r\n",
      "my interest in public affairs. My father, the pioneer apostle of an\r\n",
      "unpopular faith, ministered in a small church of brick faced with\r\n",
      "stone to a congregation which, though few in numbers, contained some\r\n",
      "remarkable people. Millard Fillmore and his partner, Nathan K. Hall,\r\n",
      "soon to be Postmaster-General, were of his fold, together with Hiram\r\n",
      "Barton, the city's mayor, and other figures locally noteworthy.\r\n",
      "Fillmore was only an accidental President, dominated, no doubt, and\r\n",
      "dwarfed in the perspective by greater men, while the part he played\r\n",
      "in a great crisis brought upon him obloquy with many good people. \"Say\r\n",
      "what you will about Fillmore,\" said a fellow-totterer to me the other\r\n",
      "day, adjusting his \"store\" teeth for an emphatic declaration, \"by\r\n",
      "signing the Fugitive Slave Bill he saved the country. That act\r\n",
      "postponed the Civil War ten years. Had it come in 1850, as it\r\n",
      "assuredly would but for that scratch of Fillmore's pen, the Union\r\n",
      "would have gone by the board. The decade that followed greatly\r\n",
      "increased the relative strength of the North. A vast immigration\r\n",
      "poured in which almost universally came to stand for the Union.\r\n",
      "Moreover the expanding West, whose natural outlet until then had been\r\n",
      "down the Mississippi to the South, became now linked to the East by\r\n",
      "great lines of railroad, and West and East entered into such a new\r\n",
      "bond of sympathy that there was nothing for it, in a time of trial,\r\n",
      "but to stand together. As it was, it was only by the narrowest margin\r\n",
      "that the Union weathered the storm. Had it come ten years earlier,\r\n",
      "wreck would have been inevitable, and it is to Fillmore's signature\r\n",
      "that we owe that blessed postponement.\" As the old man spoke, I had a\r\n",
      "vision of the grave, troubled face of my father as he told us once of\r\n",
      "a talk he had just had with Mr. Fillmore. The relations of the\r\n",
      "pastor and the parishioner, always cordial, had become more than ever\r\n",
      "friendly through an incident creditable to both. Mr. Fillmore had\r\n",
      "good-naturedly offered my father a chaplaincy in the Navy, a post with\r\n",
      "a comfortable salary, which he might easily hold, taking now and then\r\n",
      "a pleasant sea-cruise with light duties, or indeed not leaving home\r\n",
      "at all, by occasional trips and visits to the one man-of-war which the\r\n",
      "Government maintained on the Great Lakes. To an impecunious minister,\r\n",
      "with a large family to educate, it was a tempting offer. But my father\r\n",
      "in those days was a peace-man, and he was also disinclined to nibble\r\n",
      "at the public crib while rendering no adequate service. He declined\r\n",
      "the appointment, a course much censured. \"The fool parson, to let\r\n",
      "such a chance go!\" Mr. Fillmore admired it and their friendship became\r\n",
      "heartier than ever. In the interview, my father had asked his friend\r\n",
      "to explain his course on the Fugitive Slave Law, an act involving\r\n",
      "suffering for so many, and no doubt took on a tone of remonstrance. He\r\n",
      "told us the President raised his hands in vehement appeal. He had only\r\n",
      "a choice between terrible evils--to inflict suffering which he hoped\r\n",
      "might be temporary, or to precipitate an era of bloodshed with the\r\n",
      "destruction of the country as a probable result. He did not do\r\n",
      "evil that good might come, but of two imminent evils he had, as he\r\n",
      "believed, chosen the lesser.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fillmore lives in my memory a stately, massive presence, with hair\r\n",
      "growing grey and kindly blue eyes looking down upon the little boy\r\n",
      "with a pleasant greeting. His wife was gentle and unassuming. His\r\n",
      "daughter Abby matured into much beauty and grace, and her sudden\r\n",
      "death, by cholera, in the bloom of young womanhood cast a shadow\r\n",
      "on the nation. They were homely folk, thrust up suddenly into high\r\n",
      "position, but it did not turn their heads. In their lives they were\r\n",
      "plainly sweet and honest. No taint of corruption attaches to Fillmore\r\n",
      "in either his private or public career. He was my father's friend. I\r\n",
      "think he meant well, and am glad that our most authoritative historian\r\n",
      "of the period, Rhodes, can say that he discharged the duties of his\r\n",
      "high office \"with ability and honour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When in February, 1861, Abraham Lincoln, on his way to Washington,\r\n",
      "arrived in Buffalo Saturday night and it became known he would spend\r\n",
      "Sunday, the town was alive with curiosity as to where he would go\r\n",
      "to church. Mr. Lincoln was Mr. Fillmore's guest. They had known\r\n",
      "each other well in Congress--Fillmore a veteran at the head of the\r\n",
      "Committee of Ways and Means, Lincoln then quite unknown, serving his\r\n",
      "only term. Both were Whigs of the old school, in close contact and I\r\n",
      "suppose not afterwards far apart. Lincoln was prepared to execute\r\n",
      "the Fugitive Slave Law, while Fillmore was devoted to the Union,\r\n",
      "and probably would have admitted at the end that Lincoln's course\r\n",
      "throughout was good. My father's church was looked on somewhat\r\n",
      "askance. \"It's lucky,\" said a parishioner once, \"that it has a\r\n",
      "stone face.\" Would Lincoln go to the Unitarian church? Promptly at\r\n",
      "service-time Mr. Fillmore appeared with his guest, the two historic\r\n",
      "figures side by side in the pew. Two or three rows intervened between\r\n",
      "it and that in which sat my mother and our household. I beheld the\r\n",
      "scene only through the eyes of my kindred, for by that time I had\r\n",
      "flown the nest. But I may be pardoned for noting here an interesting\r\n",
      "spectacle. As they stood during the hymns, the contrast was\r\n",
      "picturesque. Both men had risen from the rudest conditions through\r\n",
      "much early hardship. Fillmore had been rocked in a sap-trough in a\r\n",
      "log-cabin scarcely better than Lincoln's early shelter, and the two\r\n",
      "might perhaps have played an even match at splitting rails. Fillmore,\r\n",
      "however, strangely adaptive, had taken on a marked grace of manner,\r\n",
      "his fine stature and mien carrying a dignified courtliness which is\r\n",
      "said to have won him a handsome compliment from Queen Victoria--a\r\n",
      "gentleman rotund, well-groomed, conspicuously elegant. Shoulder to\r\n",
      "shoulder with him rose the queer, raw-boned, ramshackle frame of\r\n",
      "the Illinoisan, draped in the artless handiwork of a prairie tailor,\r\n",
      "surmounted by the rugged, homely face. The service, which the new\r\n",
      "auditor followed reverently, being finished, the minister, leaving the\r\n",
      "pulpit, gave Lincoln God-speed--and so he passed on to his greatness.\r\n",
      "My mother, sister, and brothers--the youngest of whom before two years\r\n",
      "were gone was to fill a soldier's grave--stood close at hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I once saw Stephen A. Douglas, the man who was perhaps more closely\r\n",
      "associated than any other with the fame of Lincoln, for he was the\r\n",
      "human obstacle by overcoming whom Lincoln proved his fitness for the\r\n",
      "supreme place. Douglas was a man marvellously strong. Rhodes declares\r\n",
      "it would be hard to set bounds to his ability. I saw him in 1850, when\r\n",
      "he was yet on the threshold, just beginning to make upon the country\r\n",
      "an impress of power. Fillmore had recently, through Taylor's death,\r\n",
      "become President, and was making his first visit to his home after his\r\n",
      "elevation, with members of his Cabinet and other conspicuous figures\r\n",
      "of his party. How Douglas came to be of the company I wonder, for he\r\n",
      "was an ardent Jacksonian Democrat, but there he was on the platform\r\n",
      "before the multitude, and I, a boy of sixteen, watched him curiously,\r\n",
      "for he was young as compared with the grey heads about him. His\r\n",
      "image, as he stood up to speak, is very clear to me even now--a face\r\n",
      "strong-featured and ruddy with vigour beneath a massive forehead\r\n",
      "whose thatch had the blackness and luxuriance of youth. His trunk was\r\n",
      "disproportionately large, carried on legs sturdy enough but noticeably\r\n",

      "very near the ground.\" It is worth while to remark on this physical\r\n",
      "peculiarity because it was the direct opposite of Lincoln's\r\n",
      "configuration. He, while comparatively short-bodied, had, as all the\r\n",
      "world knows, an abnormal length of limb, a fact which I suppose will\r\n",
      "account for much of his ungainly manner. In an ordinary chair he was\r\n",

      "feet on the table or over the mantelpiece. The two fought each other\r\n",
      "long and sternly on those memorable platforms in Illinois in 1858, and\r\n",
      "in their physique there must have been, as they stood side by side,\r\n",
      "a grotesque parody of their intellectual want of harmony. Douglas's\r\n",
      "usual sobriquet was \"the little giant,\" and it fitted well--a man\r\n",

      "that, taken generally, his doctrine of \"squatter sovereignty\" was\r\n",
      "right. Congress ought not to have power to fix a status for people of\r\n",
      "future generations. If a status so fixed becomes repugnant it will be\r\n",
      "repudiated, and rightfully. Douglas was certainly cool over the woes\r\n",

      "opportunity offered, from the ownership of slaves or from the proceeds\r\n",

      "magnanimous and it was a pleasant scene, at the inauguration of March\r\n",
      "4, 1861, when Douglas sat close by holding Lincoln's hat. There was\r\n",
      "an interview between the two men behind closed doors, on the night the\r\n",
      "news of Sumter came, of which one would like to have a report. Lincoln\r\n",
      "came out from it to issue, through the Associated Press, his call\r\n",
      "for troops, and Douglas to send by the same channel the appeal to his\r\n",

      "perplexed. My mother's family were perfervid Abolitionists, accepting\r\n",

      "the other adored, in each case with fiery vehemence, and in my little\r\n",
      "world the contrasting passions were wildly ablaze. In the mass that\r\n",
      "crowded Faneuil Hall we waited long, an interval partly filled by the\r\n",
      "eccentric and eloquent Father Taylor, the seamen's preacher, whom\r\n",
      "the crowd espied in the gallery and summoned clamorously. My mood was\r\n",

      "buff vest usual to him on public occasions, which hung loosely\r\n",

      "expected, the dome above, the deep eyes looking from the caverns, the\r\n",
      "strong nose and chin, but it was the front of a dying lion. His colour\r\n",
      "was heavily sallow, and he walked with a slow, uncertain step. His\r\n",
      "low, deep intonations conveyed a solemn suggestion of the sepulchre.\r\n",
      "His speech was brief, a recognition of the honour shown him, an\r\n",
      "expression of his belief that the policy he had advocated and followed\r\n",

      "could \"sit and grin,\" like young Dr. Holmes, at the queernesses of\r\n",

      "push to have his ability acknowledged. We used to aver that he never\r\n",
      "said anything, and that it was only his big way that carried the\r\n",
      "crowd. I have in mind an old-time report of one of his deliverances:\r\n",

      "of secession. The Constitution was obscure about it, and one easily\r\n",
      "became befogged if he sought to weigh the right and the wrong of it.\r\n",

      "\"spoke pieces,\" and in thousands of schoolhouses the favourite piece\r\n",
      "was his matchless peroration. From its opening, \"When my eyes shall\r\n",

      "the final outburst, \"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and\r\n",

      "Lord's Prayer, and scarcely less consecrated. No logical unravelling\r\n",
      "of the tangle, but that burning expression of devotion to the Union,\r\n",
      "lay behind the enthusiasm with which we sprang to arms. The ghost of\r\n",

      "wagged us into international complications, and there is a war-time\r\n",
      "anecdote, which I have never seen in print and I believe is\r\n",
      "unhackneyed, which casts a light. A general of the army, talking with\r\n",
      "Lincoln and the Cabinet, did not spare his oaths. \"What church do you\r\n",
      "attend?\" interposed the President at last, stroking his chin in his\r\n",
      "innocent way. Confused at an inquiry so foreign to the topic under\r\n",

      "practically Lincoln while he himself stood at the front to manage the\r\n",

      "gilt-edged through an elegant culture, well appointed according to\r\n",

      "effectually shelved. By the side of the robust protagonists of those\r\n",

      "rather through their fate than through their fault perhaps that they\r\n",

      "in postponement of the slavery agitation the wiser course, they were\r\n",
      "retired from the front, it is easy to see why the world judged them\r\n",
      "as it did. Everett's son, Mr. Sidney Everett, at one time Assistant\r\n",
      "Secretary of State, was my classmate, and honoured me once with a\r\n",
      "request to edit his father's works. I declined the task, but not from\r\n",
      "the feeling that the task was not worth doing. Everett had the idea\r\n",
      "that the armed rush of the North and South against each other might\r\n",
      "be stayed even at the last, by reviving in them the veneration for\r\n",
      "Washington, a sentiment shared by both. The delivery of his oration on\r\n",
      "Washington as a means to that end was well meant, but pathetic in its\r\n",
      "complete futility to accomplish such a purpose. So small a spill of\r\n",
      "oil upon a sea so raging! He was a master of beautiful periods, and I\r\n",
      "desire here to record my testimony that he also possessed a power\r\n",
      "for off-hand speech. The tradition is that his utterances were\r\n",
      "all elaborately studied, down to the gestures and the play of the\r\n",
      "features. I have heard him talk on the spur of the moment, starting\r\n",

      "idol of the radicals--at once the most banned and the most blessed\r\n",

      "moved not by pedals but by thrusting the feet against the ground.\r\n",
      "This Sumner kept in his room, carrying it painfully up the stairs, and\r\n",
      "practised on it with the result, his size and energy being so\r\n",

      "offender would be reported to the college authorities.\r\n",

      "complaining between sobs that he was the victim of injustice, and\r\n",
      "upbraiding the proctor. My father was short with him; he had brought\r\n",
      "it upon himself, the penalty was only reasonable, and it would be\r\n",
      "manly for him to take it good-naturedly. Long afterward, when Sumner\r\n",

      "The old difference was not quite effaced. I told him as sturdily as I\r\n",
      "could that I was the son of his old proctor and that I had often heard\r\n",
      "my father tell the story. He said plainly he thought it unnecessary\r\n",
      "and unfair, and that that was the only time since his childhood when\r\n",
      "he had received a formal censure. Long after, he received censure from\r\n",
      "the Massachusetts Legislature for an act greatly to his credit, the\r\n",
      "suggestion that the captured battle-flags should be returned to the\r\n",
      "Southern regiments from which they had been taken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it was only a momentary flash. He settled back into the easy-chair\r\n",
      "with invalid languor, and began to tell me good-naturedly about his\r\n",
      "old velocipede, describing its construction, and the feats he had been\r\n",
      "able to perform on it, clumsy though it was. He could keep up with a\r\n",
      "fast horse in riding into Boston, but at the cost of a good pair of\r\n",
      "shoes. The contrivance supported the weight of the body, which rolled\r\n",
      "forward on the wheels, leaving the legs free to speed the machine\r\n",
      "by alternate rapid kicks. From that he branched off into college\r\n",
      "athletics of his day in a pleasant fashion, and at the end of the not\r\n",
      "short interview I felt I had enjoyed a great privilege.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another contact with Charles Sumner was a rather memorable one. We\r\n",
      "were in the second year of the Civil War. He was in his high place,\r\n",
      "Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the Senate, a main\r\n",
      "pillar of the Northern cause. I meantime had been ordained as minister\r\n",
      "of a parish in the Connecticut valley, and was a zealous upholder of\r\n",
      "the cause of the Union. John A. Andrew was Governor of Massachusetts.\r\n",
      "I had come to know him through having preached in the church at\r\n",
      "Hingham with which he was connected. He was superintendent of the\r\n",
      "Sunday-school, and had introduced me once for an address to his\r\n",
      "charge. We were theologically in sympathy, but for me it was a closer\r\n",
      "bond that he was the great war Governor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At an Amherst commencement we had talked about recruiting in the\r\n",
      "Connecticut valley, and he had impressed me much. Short in stature,\r\n",
      "square, well-set in frame, he had a strong head and face. His colour\r\n",
      "was white and pink almost like that of a boy, and the resolute blue\r\n",
      "eyes looked out from under an abundant mat of light curling hair that\r\n",
      "confirmed the impression he made of youth. Not many months before, he\r\n",
      "had been the target of much ridicule, being held over-anxious about a\r\n",
      "coming storm. He had bought three thousand overcoats for the militia,\r\n",
      "and otherwise busied himself to have soldiers ready. He was \"our merry\r\n",
      "Andrew.\" But the Massachusetts Sixth had been first on the ground\r\n",
      "at Washington, with many more close behind, and the Governor had had\r\n",
      "splendid vindication.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Early in September, 1862, I went to Boston with a deputation of\r\n",
      "selectmen from four towns of the Connecticut valley. They had an\r\n",
      "errand, and my function was, as an acquaintance of the Governor, to\r\n",
      "introduce them. Little we knew of what had just happened in Virginia,\r\n",
      "the dreadful second Bull Run campaign, with the driving in upon\r\n",
      "Washington of the routed Pope, and the pending invasion of Maryland.\r\n",
      "The despatches, while not concealing disappointment, told an\r\n",
      "over-flattering tale. More troops were wanted for a speedy finishing\r\n",
      "of the war, which we fondly believed was, in spite of all, nearing its\r\n",
      "end. Our errand was to ask that in a regiment about to be raised in\r\n",
      "two western counties the men might have the privilege of electing the\r\n",
      "officers, a pernicious practice which had been in vogue, and always\r\n",
      "done much harm. But in those days our eyes were not open.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Entering the Governor's room in the State House with my farmer\r\n",
      "selectmen, I found it densely thronged. Among the civilians were many\r\n",
      "uniforms, and men of note in the field and out stood there in waiting.\r\n",
      "Charles Sumner presently entered the room, dominating the company by\r\n",
      "his commanding presence, that day apparently in full vigour,\r\n",
      "alert, forceful, with a step before which the crowd gave way, his\r\n",
      "masterfulness fully recognised and acknowledged. He took his seat with\r\n",
      "the air of a prince of the blood at the table, close at hand to the\r\n",
      "Chief Magistrate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Naturally abashed, but feeling I was in for a task which must be\r\n",
      "pushed through, I made my way to the other elbow of the Governor, who,\r\n",
      "looking up from his documents, recognised me politely and asked what\r\n",
      "I wanted. I stated our case, that a deputation from Franklin and\r\n",
      "Hampshire counties desired the privilege for the men of the new\r\n",
      "regiment about to be raised to elect their own officers, and not be\r\n",
      "commanded by men whom they did not know.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where are your selectmen?\" said Governor Andrew, rising and pushing\r\n",
      "back his chair with an energy which I thought ominous. My companions\r\n",
      "had taken up a modest position in a far corner. When I pointed them\r\n",
      "out, the Governor made no pause, but proceeded to pour upon them\r\n",
      "and me a torrent of impassioned words. He said that we were making\r\n",
      "trouble, that the country was in peril, and that while he was trying\r\n",
      "to send every available man to the front in condition to do effective\r\n",
      "work he was embarrassed at home by petty interference with his\r\n",
      "efforts. \"I have at hand soldiers who have proved themselves brave\r\n",
      "in action, have been baptised in blood and fire. They are fit through\r\n",
      "character and experience to be leaders, and yet I cannot give them\r\n",
      "commissions because I am blocked by this small and unworthy spirit of\r\n",
      "hindrance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For some minutes the warm outburst went on. The white, beardless face\r\n",
      "flushed up under the curls, and his hands waved in rapid gesture. \"A\r\n",
      "capital speech, your Excellency,\" cried out Sumner, \"a most capital\r\n",
      "speech!\" and he led the way in a peal of applause in which the crowd\r\n",
      "in the chamber universally joined, and which must have rung across\r\n",
      "Beacon Street to the Common far away. My feeble finger had touched the\r\n",
      "button which brought this unexpected downpour, and for the moment I\r\n",
      "was unpleasantly in the limelight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now introduce me to your selectmen,\" said Governor Andrew, stepping\r\n",
      "to my side. I led the way to the corner to which the delegation had\r\n",
      "retreated, and presented my friends in turn. His manner changed. He\r\n",
      "was polite and friendly, and when, after a hand-shaking, he went back\r\n",
      "to his table, we felt we had not understood the situation and that our\r\n",
      "petition should have been withheld. For my part, I enlisted at once as\r\n",
      "a private and went into a strenuous campaign.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sumner was intrepid, high-purposed, and accomplished, but what is\r\n",
      "the world saying now of his judgment? His recent friendly but\r\n",
      "discriminating biographer, Prof. George H. Haynes, declares that\r\n",
      "even in matters of taste he was at fault. The paintings he thought\r\n",
      "masterpieces, his gift to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, are for the\r\n",
      "most part consigned to the lumber-room. In sculpture his judgment\r\n",
      "was not better. As to literary art, his writing was ponderous and\r\n",
      "over-weighted with far-fetched allusion. The world felt horror at\r\n",
      "the attack of Brooks, but the whole literature of invective contains\r\n",
      "nothing more offensive than the language of Sumner which provoked it\r\n",
      "and which he lavished right and left upon opponents who were sometimes\r\n",
      "honourable. It was in the worst of taste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In great affairs his service was certainly large. Perhaps he was at\r\n",
      "his highest in the settlement of the _Trent affair_, but his\r\n",
      "course in general in guiding our foreign relations was able\r\n",
      "and useful. He put his hand to much reconstruction of ideas and\r\n",
      "institutions. Often he made, but too often he marred. He suffered\r\n",
      "sadly from the lack of a sense of humour. \"What does Lincoln mean?\"\r\n",
      "he would blankly exclaim, impervious alike to the drollery and to the\r\n",
      "keen prod concealed within it. In his fancied superiority he sought to\r\n",
      "patronise and dominate the rude Illinoisian. The case is pathetic. The\r\n",

      "immediately behind Sheridan, and had a good chance to study the sinewy\r\n",
      "little man in his trim uniform which showed every movement of his\r\n",

      "in repose, but it was the repose of a leopard; at a sudden call, every\r\n",
      "fibre would evidently become tense, the servant of a nimble brain, and\r\n",
      "an instant pounce upon any opposition could be depended upon. What a\r\n",

      "At the Harvard commemoration of 1865, standing under the archway at\r\n",
      "the northern end of Gore Hall, I encountered the thin, plainly clad\r\n",
      "figure of Ralph Waldo Emerson. I was in soldier's dress and as he gave\r\n",

      "General, as he gave my hand a cordial pressure, beamed down upon me\r\n",
      "with pleasant eyes. In the peaceful time that had come, we were all\r\n",

      "Of our other great commanders I never saw Thomas, but my knowledge of\r\n",
      "Sherman was something more than the mere glimpse I had of the figures\r\n",
      "of his compeers. His home was in St. Louis, in which city I was then\r\n",
      "residing, and he was much in society. He was really a Connecticut\r\n",
      "Yankee though transplanted to Ohio, and he was, in figure and\r\n",
      "character, thoroughly a New Englander. He was tall and slender, his\r\n",
      "prominent forehead standing out from light straight hair, a stubby\r\n",
      "beard veiling a well-pronounced and well-worked jaw (for he was one of\r\n",
      "the readiest of talkers), it would require little scratching to get\r\n",
      "to the uncontaminated Yankee underneath. A New Englander of the best\r\n",
      "type, shrewd, kindly, deeply concerned for the welfare of his country\r\n",
      "and of men. A fashionable lady invited him to dine without his wife.\r\n",
      "Sherman, on arriving, found other ladies present; to his hostess, who\r\n",
      "came forward to receive him with effusion, he said: \"Madam, I dine\r\n",
      "with Mrs. Sherman to-night,\" and the party went forward without the\r\n",
      "lion who was to have given it distinction. He would not have his wife\r\n",
      "slighted; nor in more important things would he endure to see a\r\n",
      "lame outcome when he might set things in better shape. He encouraged\r\n",
      "schools and worthy charities by giving them his hearty countenance.\r\n",
      "No arm was more potent than his in saving the country, nor was his\r\n",
      "patriotism selfish. He saved his country because he believed it was\r\n",
      "for the good of the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sherman has been criticised for his ruthlessness, but no one can say\r\n",
      "that he was not effective. He bore on hard but with the belief that\r\n",
      "only such action could bring the war to a close. No one could come in\r\n",
      "contact with him without feeling that he was a soft-hearted man. It\r\n",
      "was one of the most interesting evenings of my life when, as a guest\r\n",
      "of N.O. Nelson, the philanthropic captain of industry in St. Louis,\r\n",
      "I was one of a company of a dozen to hear Sherman tell John Fiske his\r\n",
      "story of the war. We sat at table from seven o'clock until midnight,\r\n",
      "the two illustrious figures with their heads together exchanging a\r\n",
      "rapid fire of question and answer, but the rest of us were by no means\r\n",
      "silent. Sherman was full of affability and took good-naturedly the\r\n",
      "sharp inquiries. \"How was it, General, at Shiloh; was not your line\r\n",
      "quite too unguarded on the Corinth side, and was not the coming on of\r\n",
      "Sidney Johnston a bad surprise for you?\" \"Oh, later in the war,\" said\r\n",
      "Sherman, \"we no doubt should have done differently, but we got ready\r\n",
      "for them as they came on.\" \"Was there not bad demoralisation,\" I\r\n",
      "said, \"ten thousand or more skulkers huddled under the bluff on the\r\n",
      "Tennessee?\" \"Oh,\" said Sherman, \"the rear of an army in battle is\r\n",
      "always a sorry place; but on the firing line, where I was, things\r\n",
      "did not look so bad.\"--\"Your adversaries, General, were often good\r\n",
      "fellows, were they not, and you are good friends now?\" \"The best\r\n",
      "fellows in the world,\" said Sherman, \"and as to friendship, Hood wants\r\n",
      "me to be his literary executor and take care of his memoirs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was ready to confess to mistakes, and with frank and proper\r\n",
      "exultation pointed out the gradual improvement and the triumphant\r\n",
      "result. Plenty of good stories and much hearty laughter came in among\r\n",
      "the more tragic episodes. We saw John Fiske take it all in, swaying\r\n",
      "in his chair ponderously back and forth, but the _War in the\r\n",
      "Mississippi Valley_, which came out soon after, showed that his\r\n",
      "memory retained every point. On another occasion, as Sherman on a\r\n",
      "stormy night took me home in his carriage, we skirted the blocks which\r\n",
      "had been the site of Camp Jackson, the first field of the Civil War\r\n",
      "that Sherman had witnessed. That was the beginning of things in\r\n",
      "the West, and he on that day only a by-stander. He was at the time\r\n",
      "possibly irresolute as to what he should do, and he certainly had no\r\n",
      "premonition of the large part he was destined to play. As he looked\r\n",
      "out of the window that night into the driving storm on the spot where\r\n",
      "once he had brooded so anxiously, I wondered if he had any memory of\r\n",
      "the soul struggle of that crisis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After his death, there took place in the streets of St. Louis an\r\n",
      "imposing military funeral. As the cortège paused for a moment, I stood\r\n",
      "at the side of the gun-carriage which bore the coffin wrapped in the\r\n",
      "flag, and paid my tribute to this good man and great citizen who had\r\n",
      "played his part well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A controversy, which has now died away, used to be waged during\r\n",
      "and soon after the Civil War as to whether West Point had really\r\n",
      "vindicated a place for itself. Many an American, full of that\r\n",
      "over-confidence which besets us, maintained that a man could become a\r\n",
      "good soldier by a turn of the hand as it were. Given courage, physical\r\n",
      "vigour, and fair practical aptitude, a lawyer, a merchant, or a civil\r\n",
      "engineer could take sword in hand and at short notice head a squadron\r\n",
      "or muster an army. This view has so far as I know been set forward by\r\n",
      "no one more plausibly than by Jacob D. Cox, a stout civilian soldier\r\n",
      "who led well the Twenty-third Corps and later became Governor of Ohio\r\n",
      "and a successful Secretary of the Interior. I once met General Cox\r\n",
      "in an interesting way, on a Sunday afternoon, at the home of Judge\r\n",
      "Alfonso Taft at Walnut Hills, a pleasant suburb of Cincinnati. Judge\r\n",
      "Taft in those days was a somewhat noteworthy figure. He had served the\r\n",
      "country well as Minister to Russia and also as a member of the Cabinet\r\n",
      "at Washington, and was one of the foremost men of the fair city where\r\n",
      "he lived. His sister-in-law married an intimate friend of mine, and\r\n",
      "there were other reasons which gave me some title to his notice, and I\r\n",
      "was for the time his guest. A sturdy white-haired boy of ten or so sat\r\n",
      "at the table at dinner and hung with his brothers about the group of\r\n",
      "elders as they talked in the afternoon. This boy was William H.\r\n",
      "Taft taking in the scraps of talk as the chatting progressed on his\r\n",
      "father's porch. General Cox dropped in for an afternoon call and I\r\n",
      "scanned eagerly his scholarly face and figure, well knit through the\r\n",
      "harshest experiences in camp and battle. He was a man of fine tastes\r\n",
      "and well accomplished both in science and literature with a substratum\r\n",
      "of manly tenacity and good sense, who did noble duty on many a field\r\n",
      "and produced, in his _Military Reminiscences_ one of our most\r\n",
      "satisfactory books on the Civil War period. The manner of the veteran\r\n",
      "was simple and pleasant. Nothing betrayed that he had been the hero\r\n",
      "in such an eventful past. I have of course no thought of sketching his\r\n",
      "career or criticising his account of it. As to the point to which I\r\n",
      "have referred, his claim that a peaceful American can be turned into\r\n",
      "a soldier off-hand and that the West Pointers no more made good in the\r\n",
      "war than did the civilians, he sets forth the case calmly. He takes\r\n",
      "the curriculum at West Point as it was sixty years ago and plainly\r\n",
      "shows that as regards acquirements in general it bears a poor\r\n",
      "comparison with that of civilian universities and colleges of\r\n",
      "that period. As to especial military education, he claims that the\r\n",
      "instruction at West Point was comparatively trifling; the cadets were\r\n",
      "well drilled only in the elements, while as regards the larger matters\r\n",
      "of strategy and the management of armies there was slight opportunity\r\n",
      "to learn. The cadet came out qualified to drill a company or at most\r\n",
      "a regiment, while as to manoeuvring of divisions and corps he had no\r\n",
      "chance to perfect himself. The cadet, moreover, had this handicap--he\r\n",
      "had been made the slave of routine and his natural enterprise had been\r\n",
      "so far repressed that he magnified petty details and precedents and\r\n",
      "was slow to adapt himself to an unlooked-for emergency. He cites an\r\n",
      "example where he himself was set to fight a battle by a West Point\r\n",
      "superior with old-fashioned muzzle-loading guns, the improved arms\r\n",
      "which were at hand and which might easily have been used with good\r\n",
      "effect remaining in the rear. His conclusion is that a wide-awake\r\n",
      "American trained in the hustle of daily life, with a good basis of\r\n",
      "common sense and some capacity for adaptation, could, with a few\r\n",
      "month's experience, undertake to good advantage the direction of\r\n",
      "soldiers, and that the West Point preceding 1861 had an influence\r\n",
      "rather nugatory in bringing about success. It is perhaps sufficient\r\n",
      "answer to arguments of this kind that while during our Civil War there\r\n",
      "was a most relentless sifting of men for high positions, little regard\r\n",
      "being paid to the education and antecedents of those submitted to it,\r\n",
      "the men who finally emerged at the front were almost exclusively West\r\n",
      "Pointers. Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, and Thomas, the Union champions\r\n",
      "_par excellence_, were West Pointers. Lee, Stonewall Jackson,\r\n",
      "the Johnstons, and Longstreet are no less conspicuous among the\r\n",
      "Confederates. Civilians for the most part were not found in the high\r\n",
      "places, or if they were so placed the results were unfortunate, as in\r\n",
      "the cases of Butler, Banks, and McClernand. There were of course\r\n",
      "good soldiers who came from civil life. Cox himself is a conspicuous\r\n",
      "instance, and there were Terry, John A. Logan, and other good division\r\n",
      "commanders. On the Southern side may be instanced N.B. Forrest and\r\n",
      "J.B. Gordon; but these men rarely attained to more than secondary\r\n",
      "positions, the highest places falling, as if by gravitation, into the\r\n",
      "hands of West Pointers. An influence there was in the little academy\r\n",
      "on the Hudson which somehow brought to pass a superior warlike\r\n",
      "efficiency. The training at West Point, supplemented as it usually was\r\n",
      "by campaigning on the plains, although duty was done only by men in\r\n",
      "squads, and the hardships and perils were scarcely greater than those\r\n",
      "encountered by the ordinary pioneer and railroad-builder, somehow\r\n",
      "evoked the field-marshal quality and made it easier to grapple\r\n",
      "with the tremendous problems with which the army was so suddenly\r\n",
      "confronted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A certain pathos attaches to the story of some of those civilian\r\n",
      "soldiers. In my youthful days, I had often seen N.P. Banks, who had\r\n",
      "risen from the humblest beginning into much political importance. No\r\n",
      "large distinction can be claimed for him in any direction, and for\r\n",
      "elevation of character he was certainly not marked; but he was a man\r\n",
      "of respectable ability and he climbed creditably from factory-boy to\r\n",
      "mechanic and thence (through no noisome paths) to Congress, to the\r\n",
      "post of Governor, and to the Speakership at Washington.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had military ambition and with the beginning of the war went\r\n",
      "at once into the army, unfortunately for him, as major-general\r\n",
      "and commander of a department. Could he have gone in as captain or\r\n",
      "colonel, his fortune would probably have been different. But, sent\r\n",
      "to command in the Shenandoah Valley, it was his fate to meet at the\r\n",
      "outset the most formidable of adversaries, Stonewall Jackson. He\r\n",
      "was sorely hoodwinked and humiliated, but so were several of his\r\n",
      "successors. At Cedar Mountain, understanding that his orders were\r\n",
      "peremptory, he threw his corps upon double their numbers and fought\r\n",
      "with all the bravery in the world though with defective tactics.\r\n",
      "Another corps should have been at hand, but it failed to arrive. There\r\n",
      "was a moment when Banks, weak though he was, was near to victory, but\r\n",
      "he failed in the end in an impossible task and was made scapegoat for\r\n",
      "the blunders of others. He was sent to supersede Butler in Louisiana\r\n",
      "with a force quite inadequate for the duty expected. It was here that\r\n",
      "I came into contact with him. Interested friends had laid my case\r\n",
      "before him, as one who might serve well in a higher position than that\r\n",
      "of a private, and he good-naturedly sent word to me to report to\r\n",
      "him at a certain hour in the rotunda of the St. Charles Hôtel at New\r\n",
      "Orleans. The city was in the firm grasp of the Union, as our transport\r\n",
      "had sailed up the evening before. The ships of Farragut, their decks\r\n",
      "crowded with blue jackets held under their broad-sides a dense and\r\n",
      "sullen multitude. A heavy salute reverberated from the river as the\r\n",
      "new commander took his place, but conditions were precarious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I walked up the street in my soldier's dress, a handsome Southern\r\n",
      "girl almost ran me off the sidewalk with a look in her face which, but\r\n",
      "for fear of the calaboose, might have been backed up by words and acts\r\n",
      "of insult, while the faces of the men were full of hate. I stood\r\n",
      "at last in the rotunda of the St. Charles Hôtel and presently the\r\n",
      "commander-in-chief, threading his way through a throng of officers,\r\n",
      "was at my side. I was much dishevelled and still ill after a stormy\r\n",
      "passage in a crowded ship, but the General was very courteous to the\r\n",
      "private. He had heard of my enlistment and indicated that he would be\r\n",
      "glad to utilise me, as he desired to utilise every man, for the best\r\n",
      "welfare of the service. What did I desire? I told him I had no thought\r\n",
      "but to do my duty as well as I could wherever I might be put. He\r\n",
      "discussed the situation reasonably, then offered me a clerkship at\r\n",
      "headquarters, where I might escape the chief perils of the campaign\r\n",
      "and where perhaps my education would serve the public. For a moment I\r\n",
      "hesitated and he passed on, leaving me to decide. My friends felt that\r\n",
      "I had not the physical strength for work in the field; should I accept\r\n",
      "the snug place back of the firing-line or risk it at the front? By the\r\n",
      "next day, I had fully determined to stick to my regiment. I sought\r\n",
      "the General again at headquarters. Colonel Irwin of his staff at\r\n",
      "the moment was arranging around his shoulders the yellow sash of the\r\n",
      "major-general for the formal ceremony of taking command, which\r\n",
      "was close at hand. But the General had a kindly recognition of the\r\n",
      "private, assented to my decision, and gave me a pass to the regiment,\r\n",
      "which had already been hurried onward to the front. I laid my knapsack\r\n",
      "down by the side of that of my young brother in the camp, which was\r\n",
      "then at the front.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Banks was a kindly man who meant and did the best he could for the\r\n",
      "humblest soldier in his army. His further military career I can only\r\n",
      "briefly sketch. He planned two fierce and calamitous assaults upon\r\n",
      "Port Hudson; errors no doubt, but Grant and Lee at the moment were\r\n",
      "making just such errors. The Red River campaign was a disastrous\r\n",
      "failure, but Banks had every handicap which a general could suffer:\r\n",
      "an insufficient force, a demand from the Administration that he\r\n",
      "should attend to a civil reordering when only fighting was in place,\r\n",
      "subordinates insolent and disobedient. And finally nature herself took\r\n",
      "arms against him, for the Red River fell when, by all precedents, it\r\n",
      "should have risen. It was an enterprise which his judgment utterly\r\n",
      "disapproved, the difficulties of which he faced with good resolution.\r\n",
      "It ended his career, for though once at a later time he went to\r\n",
      "Congress, he ever afterwards stood a discredited figure, dying, as I\r\n",
      "have heard, poor and broken-hearted in obscurity. His State has tried\r\n",
      "to render him a late justice by setting him up in bronze on Beacon\r\n",
      "Hill. It was done through opposition and the statue is sneered at more\r\n",
      "often than admired. He was an able man I believe and meant well, and\r\n",
      "I for one find it pathetic that the lines of my old commander did not\r\n",
      "fall more pleasantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Butler, on the other hand, I do not regard as a pathetic figure. On\r\n",
      "the night of my arrival in New Orleans, strolling about the strange\r\n",
      "city, I found myself at headquarters, and a Massachusetts boy standing\r\n",
      "sentry on the porch in a spirit of comradeship invited me up. As I\r\n",
      "ascended the steps Butler, who had been standing at the door, closed\r\n",
      "it with a crash and retired within. Through a crevice in the blinds\r\n",
      "he was plain to be seen seated at his desk in profound thought, his\r\n",
      "bull-dog face in repose, his rude forcefulness very manifest. His rule\r\n",
      "at New Orleans had come to an end and no doubt he was pondering it and\r\n",
      "dreaming of what the future had in store for him. His burly frame was\r\n",
      "relaxed, his bluff unshaken countenance with the queer sinister cast\r\n",
      "of the eyes fully lighted up by the lamp on his table. I studied him\r\n",
      "at leisure, his marvellous energy for a moment in repose. In those\r\n",
      "days his name was much in the mouths of men, and whatever may be said\r\n",
      "in his disfavour, it cannot be denied after fifty years that his rule\r\n",
      "of New Orleans was a masterpiece of resolution, a riding rough-shod\r\n",
      "over a great disaffected city which marked him as full of intrepidity\r\n",
      "and executive force. In the field he was a worse failure than ever\r\n",
      "Banks had been. In my idea he deserves in 1864 the characterisation\r\n",
      "by Charles Francis Adams. He was the Grouchy who made futile Grant's\r\n",
      "advance upon Richmond and he blundered at Fort Fisher, but he was a\r\n",
      "pachyderm of the toughest--too thick-skinned to be troubled by\r\n",
      "the scratches of criticism, always floundering to the front with\r\n",
      "unquenched energy, sometimes a power for good and sometimes for evil.\r\n",
      "It is hard to strike the balance and say whether for the most part\r\n",
      "he helped or hindered, but our past would lack a strong element of\r\n",
      "picturesqueness if old Ben Butler were eliminated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were pathetic figures among the West Pointers as well as among\r\n",
      "the civilian generals. At St. Louis, in the seventies, I used to see\r\n",
      "sometimes an unobtrusive man in citizen's dress, marked by no trait\r\n",
      "which distinguished him from the ordinary, a man serious in his\r\n",
      "bearing, who one might easily think had undergone some crushing blow.\r\n",
      "This was Major-General John Pope. His son was in our university and\r\n",
      "his sister, a most kind and gracious lady, was a near friend. Pope\r\n",
      "seems destined to go down in our history merely as a braggart and an\r\n",
      "incompetent. Probably no man of that time meant better or was more\r\n",
      "abused by capricious fate. Cox, whose daughter married the son of Pope\r\n",
      "and who therefore came to know him well in his later years, defends\r\n",
      "him vigorously. In the early years of the war he showed himself bold\r\n",
      "and active. The capture of Island Number Ten with its garrison was\r\n",
      "rather a naval and engineering exploit than an achievement of the\r\n",
      "army, but Pope seems to have done well what was required of him and\r\n",
      "probably deserved his promotion to the command of a corps at Corinth\r\n",
      "when an advance southward was meditated in the early summer of '62.\r\n",
      "It was with deep unwillingness that he received the summons of the\r\n",
      "Administration to command an army in Virginia, and only assumed the\r\n",
      "place from the feeling that a soldier must stand where he is put.\r\n",
      "Arrived at Washington, he found himself in an atmosphere hot with\r\n",
      "wrath and mortification. The Peninsular campaign had failed and strong\r\n",
      "spirits like Stanton and Ben Wade, Chairman of the Committee on the\r\n",
      "Conduct of the War, were on fire through disappointment. The new\r\n",
      "General, whose position until within a few months had been a humble\r\n",
      "one, was brow-beaten and dominated by powerful personalities and\r\n",
      "forced to stand for acts and words which were not really his own.\r\n",
      "He declared, said Cox, that his bombastic and truculent orders were\r\n",
      "practically dictated by others. The declaration that his headquarters\r\n",
      "would be his saddle, which Lee so wittily turned, saying, \"then\r\n",
      "his headquarters would be where his hindquarters ought to be,\" Pope\r\n",
      "declares he never made. When his environment had in this way aroused\r\n",
      "prejudice against him, he was set to command an army whose higher\r\n",
      "officers felt outraged at his sudden rise over their heads and whose\r\n",
      "soldiers were discouraged by defeat. He was expected to oppose skilful\r\n",
      "and victorious foes with instruments that bent and broke in the crisis\r\n",
      "as he tried to wield them. Only supreme genius could have wrought\r\n",
      "success in such a situation, and that Pope did not at all possess. He\r\n",
      "was only a man of resolution, with no exceptional gifts, who desired\r\n",
      "to do his best for his country. In the West he had proceeded usefully\r\n",
      "and honourably, and it was the worst misfortune for him that he was\r\n",
      "taken for the new place. I hope that history will deal kindly with\r\n",
      "him and that, since he was a worthy and strenuous patriot, he will not\r\n",
      "live merely as an object of execration and ridicule.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In August, 1863, my too brief term of service having expired, I came\r\n",
      "home to the Connecticut Valley and resumed my pulpit, which I had left\r\n",
      "for a vacation and powder-smoke. Gettysburg and Vicksburg had taken\r\n",
      "place, and we at the North too fondly hoped that all was over and that\r\n",
      "we might confidently settle down to peace. When going west to Buffalo\r\n",
      "for a visit I was delayed a few hours at Syracuse and took the\r\n",
      "occasion to call on an intimate friend of my father and myself, the\r\n",
      "Rev. Samuel J. May. Mr. May, a bright and beautiful spirit, was by\r\n",
      "nature a strong peace man, but, fired by the woes of the slave, he\r\n",
      "had become an extreme abolitionist and was ready to fight for his\r\n",
      "principles. Entering Mr. May's quiet study I found him in intimate\r\n",
      "talk with a man of unassuming demeanour, in citizen's dress, marked by\r\n",
      "no distinction of face or figure. He might have been a delegate to\r\n",
      "a peace convention, or a country minister from way-back calling on a\r\n",
      "professional brother. What was my astonishment when Mr. May introduced\r\n",
      "him as Major-General Henry W. Slocum, commander of the Twelfth Corps,\r\n",
      "who, taking a short furlough after Gettysburg, was at home for the\r\n",
      "moment and had dropped in for a friendly call. Slocum had been in the\r\n",
      "thick of most of the bitter Virginia battles from the first, and all\r\n",
      "the world knew that at Gettysburg, by beating back the thrust of\r\n",
      "the Stonewall division toward the Baltimore pike, he had secured the\r\n",
      "threatened rear of the army of the Potomac and averted defeat. This\r\n",
      "had taken place in the preceding month, and I naturally marvelled that\r\n",
      "the unpretending, simple man could be that victorious champion,\r\n",
      "but for the time being we were there plain citizens, and, American\r\n",
      "fashion, the Major-General and the Corporal shook hands and\r\n",
      "fraternised on equal terms. It probably helped me with Slocum that I\r\n",
      "too had been in danger. About the time he was defending Culp's Hill, I\r\n",
      "had been in the ditch at the foot of the Port Hudson rampart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While reticent as to his part at Gettysburg, he spoke with feeling of\r\n",
      "what his corps had been through, and knowing that both Mr. May and\r\n",
      "I were Massachusetts men took an evident pleasure in commending the\r\n",
      "regiments from that State. Of the 2d Massachusetts he spoke with\r\n",
      "high appreciation; it was an admirable body of men and thoroughly\r\n",
      "disciplined. It was always ready; its losses were fearful and he felt\r\n",
      "that he ought to spare it if he could, but a crisis always came when\r\n",
      "only the best would answer, and again and again the 2d Massachusetts\r\n",
      "was thrown in. Particularly at Gettysburg its services had been great\r\n",
      "and its sacrifice costly. He spoke feelingly of the young officers who\r\n",
      "had been slain and also of humbler men. Since that time I have stood\r\n",
      "by the simple stone at the \"bloody swale at the foot of Culp's Hill,\"\r\n",
      "which marked the position held that day by the 2d Massachusetts. It\r\n",
      "takes no trained eye to see that it was a point of especial difficulty\r\n",
      "and importance. Some of the men of that regiment who fell that day\r\n",
      "were my own college comrades. I was glad to know from his lips that\r\n",
      "the commander thought their work heroic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One naturally brackets the name of Slocum with that of Howard,\r\n",
      "secondary figures of course in the great Civil War drama and yet\r\n",
      "both steadfast and worthy soldiers. They rose together into places of\r\n",
      "responsibility during the Peninsular campaign, became commanders of\r\n",
      "corps about the same time, served side by side at Gettysburg, went\r\n",
      "together to the West, and finally, one at the head of Sherman's right\r\n",
      "wing and the other at the head of the left, made the march to the sea\r\n",
      "and through the Carolinas. Neither perhaps was a brilliant soldier.\r\n",
      "So far as the records show, Slocum always did his work well, was\r\n",
      "increasingly trusted to the last, and nowhere made a grave mistake. In\r\n",
      "Howard's case, the rout at Chancellorsville will always detract from\r\n",
      "his fame; he was, however, on that day new in his place, and the\r\n",
      "infatuation of Hooker by an evil contagion passed down to his\r\n",
      "lieutenants. But he too steadily improved, refusing resolutely to be\r\n",
      "discouraged by his mistakes and always doing better next time. Perhaps\r\n",
      "no one act during the war was more important than the occupation of\r\n",
      "Cemetery Hill on the morning of July 1, 1863, by a Federal division.\r\n",
      "I think that the credit of that act cannot be denied to Howard. In\r\n",
      "a later time he passed under the control of Sherman in the West, a\r\n",
      "shrewd and relentless judge of men, and Sherman trusted him to the\r\n",
      "utmost. To a group of officers in their cups who were chaffing Howard\r\n",
      "for being Puritanical, Sherman curtly said: \"Let Howard alone; I want\r\n",
      "one general who doesn't drink.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I saw General Howard at Gettysburg on the fortieth anniversary of\r\n",
      "the battle. We were under the same roof, and during the evening I sat\r\n",
      "close to him in the common room and heard him talk,--a strenuous old\r\n",
      "man, his empty sleeve recalling tragically the combats through which\r\n",
      "he had passed. Close by under the stars could still be traced the\r\n",
      "lines occupied by Steinwehr's division, the troops which with such\r\n",
      "momentous results Howard had posted on Cemetery Hill. I might easily\r\n",
      "have talked with him, for he was affable to old and young, but I\r\n",
      "preferred to study the good veteran from a distance and let others\r\n",
      "draw out his story while I listened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the winter of 1861 I went to Port Royal, through the good offices\r\n",
      "of my friend Rufus Saxton, then a captain and quartermaster of the\r\n",
      "expedition under which Dupont had taken possession of the Sea Islands\r\n",
      "in South Carolina. The capture of Port Royal had taken place a few\r\n",
      "weeks before and the army was encamped on the conquered territory.\r\n",
      "Saxton was an interesting figure, who in an unusual way showed during\r\n",
      "the war a fine spirit of self-sacrifice. At the outbreak, a high\r\n",
      "position in the field was within his grasp; he was second in command\r\n",
      "to Lyon in St. Louis, and being intimate with McClellan might have\r\n",
      "held a position of responsibility in the field. He was indeed made a\r\n",
      "general. Once in 1862 he was in command of a considerable force,\r\n",
      "and when Banks was driven out of the Shenandoah Valley by Stonewall\r\n",
      "Jackson he withstood at Harper's Ferry the rush of the Confederates\r\n",
      "into Maryland. But at the solicitation of Lincoln and Stanton he gave\r\n",
      "up service in the field, for which he was well fitted and which he\r\n",
      "earnestly desired, to act as Military Governor of the Sea Islands,\r\n",
      "where his work was to receive and care for the thousands of negroes\r\n",
      "who by the flight of their masters in that region had been left\r\n",
      "to themselves. Here he remained throughout the war, while his old\r\n",
      "comrades were winning fame at the head of divisions and corps, a\r\n",
      "patient, humane teacher and administrator among the nation's wards.\r\n",
      "He was content to live through the stirring time inconspicuous, but he\r\n",
      "won the respect of all kindly hearts at the North and deep gratitude\r\n",
      "from the helpless blacks whom he so long and humanely befriended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I came in contact during that visit with a number of soldiers soon\r\n",

      "shore I had as a fellow-passenger James H. Wilson, then a lieutenant\r\n",
      "but soon to be a famous cavalry commander. He was a restless athletic\r\n",
      "young man, who when I met him was on fire with wrath over the giving\r\n",
      "up of Mason and Slidell, the news of which had come to the post by our\r\n",
      "steamer. I tried to argue with him, that we had enough on our hands\r\n",
      "with the South without rushing into war with England besides, but he\r\n",
      "was impetuously confident that we could take care of all foes outside\r\n",
      "and in, and maintained that the giving up of the envoys was a burning\r\n",
      "shame. His vigour and confidence were excessive, I thought, but they\r\n",
      "carried him far in a time soon to come.\r\n",

      "expedition, in his tent, but was more interested in a dispute which\r\n",
      "presently sprang up between the General and a companion of mine,\r\n",
      "Jonathan Saxton, father of Rufus Saxton, an abolitionist of the most\r\n",
      "perfervid type, a good talker and quite unabashed, plain farmer though\r\n",
      "he was, by a pair of epaulettes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Among our regular officers there were few abolitionists. Rufus Saxton\r\n",
      "told me that Lyon was the only one of any distinction who could be so\r\n",
      "classed among the men he knew. T.W. Sherman was like his fellows and\r\n",
      "listened impatiently to what he felt was fanaticism gone mad, but the\r\n",
      "fluent old farmer drove home his radicalism undauntedly. T.W. Sherman\r\n",
      "before the war had been a well-known figure as commander of Sherman's\r\n",
      "flying artillery, which was perhaps the most famous organisation of\r\n",
      "the regular army, but his name scarcely appears in the history of the\r\n",
      "Civil War, more perhaps from lack of good fortune than of merit. He\r\n",
      "was crippled with wounds in the first important battle in which he\r\n",
      "was concerned. The two brigadiers at Port Royal, Horatio G. Wright and\r\n",
      "Isaac I. Stevens, both became soldiers of note. Wright was a handsome\r\n",
      "fellow in his best years, whom I recall stroking his chin with an\r\n",
      "amused quizzical expression while Jonathan Saxton poured out his\r\n",
      "Garrisonism. His brigade lay well to the south and his headquarters\r\n",
      "were at the old Tybee lighthouse which marked the entrance to the\r\n",
      "harbour of Savannah. I climbed with him up the sand hill, from the top\r\n",
      "of which we looked down upon Fort Pulaski then in Confederate hands\r\n",
      "and within short range. We peered cautiously over the summit, for\r\n",
      "shells frequently came from the fort. Wright held in his hand a\r\n",
      "fragment of one which had just before exploded. \"How well it took the\r\n",
      "groove!\" he said, pointing out to me the signs on the iron that the\r\n",
      "rifled cannon from which it had come had given the missile in the\r\n",
      "discharge the proper twist. Wright's after-career is part of the\r\n",
      "war's history, always strenuous and constantly rising. The fame\r\n",
      "which attaches to the Sixth Corps is largely due to the leadership of\r\n",
      "Wright. If he fell short at Cedar Creek in 1864 it was a lapse which\r\n",
      "may be pardoned in the circumstances. Sheridan retrieved the day\r\n",
      "and magnanimously palliated the misfortune of Wright. \"It might have\r\n",
      "happened to me or to any man.\" The good soldier deserves the fine\r\n",
      "monument which stands by his grave in the foreground at Arlington.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had at Port Royal a long and friendly talk with Isaac I. Stevens. He\r\n",
      "was already a man of note. After achieving the highest honours at West\r\n",
      "Point he had gone to the West, and in the great unexplored Pacific\r\n",
      "Northwest had conquered, built, and systematised until a fair\r\n",
      "foundation was laid for the fine civilisation which now sixty years\r\n",
      "later has been reared upon it. He was modest in his bearing, with\r\n",
      "well-knit and sinewy frame, and possessed at the same time refined\r\n",
      "manners and a taste for the higher things of life. Before the year had\r\n",
      "passed, his life went out in the second battle of Bull Run. In the\r\n",
      "end of that terrible campaign, he essayed with Phil Kearny to stem at\r\n",
      "Chantilly the rush of Stonewall Jackson upon Washington. The attempt\r\n",
      "was successful, but Stevens died waving the colours at the head of\r\n",
      "his men. It is said that Lincoln had marked him for the command of the\r\n",
      "Army of the Potomac. He had made good in all previous positions, and\r\n",
      "perhaps would have made good in the chief place, but here I stumble\r\n",
      "once more upon a might-have-been and am silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dear ghosts of old-time friends swarm in my thought as I dream of\r\n",
      "those days. The white marbles in Memorial Chapel solemnly bear the\r\n",
      "names of Harvard's Civil War soldiers and tell how they died. There\r\n",
      "was one of whom I might say much, an elder companion, a wise and\r\n",
      "pleasant spirit who did something toward my shaping for life. A\r\n",
      "cannon-ball at Cold Harbor was the end for him. There was another,\r\n",
      "a brilliant, handsome young Irishman, bred a Catholic, who under the\r\n",
      "influence of Moncure D. Conway had come out as a Unitarian and left\r\n",
      "his Washington home for a radical environment in the North. He was\r\n",
      "brilliant and witty with small capacity or taste for persistent\r\n",
      "plodding, but forever hitting effectively on the spur of the moment.\r\n",
      "He was as chivalrous as a palladin and went to his early grave\r\n",
      "light-hearted, as part of the day's work which must not be shirked. I\r\n",
      "have his image vividly as he laughed and joked in our last interview.\r\n",
      "\"Dress-parade at six o'clock; come over and see the dress-paradoes!\"\r\n",
      "He fell wounded at Chancellorsville, and while being carried off the\r\n",
      "field was struck a second time as he lay on the stretcher, and so he\r\n",
      "passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were fine fellows, too, in those days who stood on the other\r\n",
      "side: McKim, President of the Hasty Pudding Club, who fell in\r\n",
      "Virginia; W.H.F. Lee, who was in the Law School and whom I recall as a\r\n",
      "stalwart athlete rowing on the Charles. It helped me much a few years\r\n",
      "ago when I visited many Southern battle-fields that I could tell old\r\n",
      "Confederates \"Rooney\" Lee and I had in our youth been college mates.\r\n",
      "My classmate J.B. Clark of Mississippi was a graceful magnetic fellow\r\n",
      "who had small basis of scholarship, perhaps, but a marked power for\r\n",
      "effective utterance. He fascinated us by his warm Southern fluency,\r\n",
      "and we gave him at last the highest distinction we could confer, the\r\n",
      "class oration. He left us then and we did not see him for fifty years.\r\n",
      "He enlisted in the 21st Mississippi and passed through the roughest\r\n",
      "hardships and perils. We felt afterwards that he held coldly aloof\r\n",
      "from us through long years. At our jubilee, however, he came back\r\n",
      "wrinkled and white-haired, but quite recognisable as the fascinating\r\n",
      "boy of fifty years before. He had a long and good record behind him as\r\n",
      "an officer of the University of Texas, and we gave him reason to think\r\n",
      "that we loved him still. The most cordial meetings I have ever known\r\n",
      "have been those between men who had fought each other bitterly, each\r\n",
      "with an honest conviction that he was in the right, but who at last\r\n",
      "have come out on common ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Among the Harvard soldiers three stand out in my thought as especially\r\n",
      "interesting, William Francis Bartlett, Charles Russell Lowell, and\r\n",
      "Francis Channing Barlow. Bartlett was younger than I, entering service\r\n",
      "when scarcely beyond boyhood, losing a leg at Ball's Bluff, and when\r\n",
      "only twenty-three Colonel of the 49th Massachusetts. I remember well\r\n",
      "a beautiful night, the moon at the full, and the hospital on the\r\n",
      "river bank just below Port Hudson where hundreds of wounded men were\r\n",
      "arriving from a disastrous battle-field close at hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bartlett had ridden into battle on horseback, his one leg making it\r\n",
      "impossible for him to go on foot, and he was a conspicuous mark for\r\n",
      "the sharpshooters. A ball had passed through his remaining foot, and\r\n",
      "still another through his arm, causing painful wounds to which he was\r\n",
      "forced to yield. He lay stretched out, a tall, slender figure with a\r\n",
      "clear-cut patrician face, very pale and still but with every sign\r\n",
      "of suffering stoically repressed. He was conscious as I stood for\r\n",
      "a moment at his side. It was not a time to speak even a word, but\r\n",
      "I hoped he might feel through some occult influence that a Harvard\r\n",
      "brother was there at hand, full of sympathy for him. He afterwards\r\n",
      "recovered in part, and, with unconquerable will, though he was only\r\n",
      "a fragment of a man, went in again and was still again stricken. He\r\n",
      "survived it all, and to me it was perhaps the most thrilling incident\r\n",
      "of the Harvard commemoration of 1865 to see Bartlett, too crippled to\r\n",
      "walk without their support, helped to a place of honour on the stage\r\n",
      "by reverent friends.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Charles Russell Lowell was in the class preceding mine; his father had\r\n",
      "been my father's classmate, and had done me many a favour; his mother\r\n",
      "was Mrs. Anna Jackson Lowell, one of the best and ablest Boston women\r\n",
      "of her time. In her house I had been a guest. Charles and James, the\r\n",
      "sons, were youths of the rarest intellectual gifts, each first scholar\r\n",
      "of his class, of whom the utmost was expected. How strange that\r\n",
      "fate should have made them soldiers! They both perished on the\r\n",
      "battle-field. As I remember Charlie Lowell, the boy was fitly the\r\n",
      "father of the man. We were playing football one day on the Delta, the\r\n",
      "old-fashioned game of those days, at which modern athletes smile, but\r\n",
      "which we old fellows think was a good tough game for all that. I had\r\n",
      "secured the ball, and thinking I had time, placed it rather leisurely,\r\n",
      "promising myself an effective kick. A slight figure bounded with\r\n",
      "lightning rush from the opposing line, and from under my very foot\r\n",
      "drove the ball far behind me to a point which secured victory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How little I knew that I had just witnessed a small exhibition of the\r\n",
      "quickness and prompt decision which no long time after on critical\r\n",
      "battle-fields were to be put to splendid use. He proved to be a nearly\r\n",
      "perfect soldier; Sheridan said of him, that he knew of no virtue that\r\n",
      "could be added to Lowell. To us he seems one of the manliest of men,\r\n",
      "thoughtful for others, even for dumb beasts. In Edward Emerson's\r\n",
      "charming life of him, nothing, perhaps, is sweeter than his affection\r\n",
      "for his horses, of which it was said that thirteen were killed under\r\n",
      "him before he came to death himself. He studied their characters as\r\n",
      "if they had been human beings, and dwells in his letters on the\r\n",
      "particular lovable traits each one showed--these mute companions who\r\n",
      "stood so closely by him in life and death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When our class first assembled in 1851 there was a slight boy\r\n",
      "of seventeen in the company, Francis Channing Barlow. He was\r\n",
      "inconspicuous through face or figure, but it early became clear that\r\n",
      "he was to be our first scholar, and a wayward deportment with an\r\n",
      "odd sardonic wit soon made him an object of interest. Barlow came\r\n",
      "admirably fitted, and this good preparation, standing back of great\r\n",
      "quickness and power of mind, made it easy for him almost without study\r\n",
      "to take a leading place. As a boy he was well grounded, outside of his\r\n",
      "special accomplishments, in Latin, Greek, and mathematics. I remember\r\n",
      "his telling me that his mother read Plutarch to him when he was a\r\n",
      "child, and that and many another good book he had thoroughly stored\r\n",
      "away. Such accomplishments were an exasperation to us poor fellows who\r\n",
      "had come in from the remote outskirts and found we must compete for\r\n",
      "honours with men so well equipped. We perhaps magnified the gifts\r\n",
      "and acquirements of the fellows who had been more favourably placed.\r\n",
      "Barlow seemed like a paragon of scholarship, and the nonchalance with\r\n",
      "which he always won in the classrooms was a constant marvel. He had a\r\n",
      "queer way of turning serious things into fun. With a freshman\r\n",
      "desire for self-improvement, a thing apt to evaporate in the college\r\n",
      "atmosphere, we had formed a society for grave writing and debate and\r\n",
      "hired for our meetings the lodge-room of the \"Glorious Apollers\" or\r\n",
      "some such organisation. At an early meeting of the society, while\r\n",
      "we were solemnly struggling through a dignified programme, Barlow\r\n",
      "suddenly appeared from a side-door rigged out most fantastically in\r\n",
      "plumes and draperies. He had somehow got hold of the regalia of the\r\n",
      "order and drawlingly announced himself as the great panjandrum who had\r\n",
      "come to take part. He danced and paraded before the conclave and had\r\n",
      "no difficulty in turning the session into a wild revel of extravagant\r\n",
      "guffaws and antics, and after that time the occasions were many when\r\n",
      "Barlow gave a comic turn to things serious. It was said that Barlow,\r\n",
      "going back and forth on the train between Concord and Boston as he\r\n",
      "did at one time, got hold of an impressionable brake-man, and by\r\n",
      "exhortation brought about in him a change of heart, after the most\r\n",
      "approved evangelical manner, counterfeiting perfectly the methods of\r\n",
      "a revivalist, which he did for the fun of the thing. The story, of\r\n",
      "course, was an invention, but quite in character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was no respecter of conventions and sometimes trod ruthlessly upon\r\n",
      "proprieties. \"What will Barlow do next?\" was always the question. In\r\n",
      "the class-room he was never rattled in any emergency, his really sound\r\n",
      "scholarship was always perfectly in hand and in a strait no one could\r\n",
      "bluff it with such _sang-froid_ and audacity. He kept his place\r\n",
      "at the head of the class to the very end, but there Robert Treat\r\n",
      "Paine came out precisely his equal. Among the many thousand marks\r\n",
      "accumulating through four years the total for both men was exactly\r\n",
      "alike--a thing which I believe has never happened before or since.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before the Arsenal in Cambridge stood an innocent old cannon that\r\n",
      "had not been fired since the War of 1812, perhaps not since the\r\n",
      "Revolution. The grass and flowers grew about its silent muzzle, and\r\n",
      "lambs might have fed there as in the pretty picture of Landseer.\r\n",
      "Any thought that the old cannon could go off had long ceased to be\r\n",
      "entertained. One quiet night a tremendous explosion took place; the\r\n",
      "cannon had waked up from its long sleep, arousing the babies over a\r\n",
      "wide region and many a pane of glass was shivered. What had got into\r\n",
      "the old cannon that night was long a mystery. Many years after Barlow\r\n",
      "was discovered at the bottom of it--it was the first shot he ever\r\n",
      "fired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dr. James Walker, the college president, said to a friend of mine at\r\n",
      "the beginning of the war, speculating on the probable futures of the\r\n",
      "boys who had been under his care, \"There's Barlow, now he'll go in\r\n",
      "and come out at the top.\" Barlow had been a sad puzzle to the faculty,\r\n",
      "good men, often perplexed to know what to do with him or what would\r\n",
      "become of him. Dr. Walker's astuteness divined well the outcome. As\r\n",
      "I review those early years I can see now that Barlow then gave plain\r\n",
      "signs of the qualities which he was later to display. I remember\r\n",
      "sleeping with him once in a room in the top story of Stoughton in\r\n",
      "our sophomore year and he talked for a great part of the night\r\n",
      "about Napoleon. The Corsican was the hero who beyond all others had\r\n",
      "fascinated him, whose career he would especially love to emulate.\r\n",
      "We were a pair of boys in a peaceful college, living in a time which\r\n",
      "apparently would afford no opportunity for a soldier's career. I have\r\n",
      "often thought of that talk. Barlow was really not unlike the youthful\r\n",
      "Napoleon, in frame he was slender and delicate, his complexion verged\r\n",
      "toward the olive, his face was always beardless. I never saw him\r\n",
      "thrown off his poise in any emergency. The straits of course are not\r\n",
      "great in which a college boy is placed, but such as they were, Barlow\r\n",
      "was always cool, with his mind working at its best in the midst of\r\n",
      "them. He was never abashed, but had a resource and an apt one in\r\n",
      "every emergency. He was absolutely intrepid before the thrusts of\r\n",
      "our sharpest examiners and as I have said could bluff it boldly and\r\n",
      "dexterously where his knowledge failed; then the odd cynicism with\r\n",
      "which he turned down great pretentions and sometimes matters of\r\n",
      "serious import, had a Napoleonic cast. In '61 he enlisted as a private\r\n",
      "but rose swiftly through the grades to the command of a regiment. At\r\n",
      "Antietam he had part of a brigade and coralled in a meteoric way on\r\n",
      "Longstreet's front line some hundreds of prisoners. His losses were\r\n",
      "great but he was in the thick of it himself, his poise unruffled\r\n",
      "until he was borne desperately wounded from the field. The surgeon who\r\n",
      "attended him told me, if I remember right, that a ball passed entirely\r\n",
      "through his body carrying with it portions of his clothing, if such\r\n",
      "a thing were possible; but, with his usual nonchalance he laughed at\r\n",
      "wounds and while still weak and emaciated went back to his place\r\n",
      "again in the following spring at the head of a brigade. He underwent\r\n",
      "Chancellorsville, and for the Union cause it was a great misfortune\r\n",
      "that his fine brigade was taken from its place on Hooker's right\r\n",
      "before Stonewall Jackson made his charge. Had Barlow been there\r\n",
      "he might have done something to stay the disaster. At Gettysburg,\r\n",
      "however, he was in the front in command of a division. An old soldier,\r\n",
      "a lieutenant that day under Barlow, told me that he had charge of the\r\n",
      "ambulances of the division and on the march near Emmitsburg Barlow put\r\n",
      "into the lieutenant's especial charge the ambulance of his wife who,\r\n",
      "with a premonition of calamity, insisted on being near at hand to\r\n",
      "help. When the battle joined and Gordon swept overwhelmingly upon\r\n",
      "Barlow's division, the lieutenant had difficulty in restraining Mrs.\r\n",
      "Barlow from rushing at once upon the field among the fighting men. He\r\n",
      "held her back almost by force but she remained close at hand.\r\n",
      "Barlow was again desperately wounded, so hurt that his death seemed\r\n",
      "inevitable, and when the faithful wife, at last making her way,\r\n",
      "presented herself even in the rebel lines with a petition for her\r\n",
      "husband, supposed to be dying, Gordon chivalrously gave him up. It\r\n",
      "was magnanimous, but for him ill-timed. Again Barlow laughed at his\r\n",
      "wounds. In May, 1864, he was in the field at the head of the first\r\n",
      "division of Hancock's corps and on the 12th of May performed the\r\n",
      "memorable exploit, breaking fairly the centre of Lee's army and\r\n",
      "bringing it nearer to defeat than it ever came until the catastrophe\r\n",
      "at Appomattox. He captured the Spottsylvania salient together with the\r\n",
      "best division of the army of northern Virginia, Stonewall Jackson's\r\n",
      "old command, two generals, thirty colours, cannon, and small arms to\r\n",
      "correspond. John Noyes, a soldier of a class after us, told me that in\r\n",
      "the salient he and Barlow worked like privates in the confusion of the\r\n",
      "capture, turning with their own hands against the enemy a cannon that\r\n",
      "had just been taken. Barlow was as cool as when he fired off the old\r\n",
      "cannon in Cambridge ten years before. This stroke proved futile, but\r\n",
      "from no shortcoming of Barlow's. A few weeks later at Cold Harbor\r\n",
      "he effected a lodgment within the Confederate works when all others\r\n",
      "failed. That too proved futile, but his reputation was confirmed\r\n",
      "as one of the most brilliant of division commanders. There is a\r\n",
      "photograph in existence portraying Hancock and his division generals\r\n",
      "as they appeared during that terrible campaign. It was taken in the\r\n",
      "woods in the utmost stress of service. Barlow stands in the group just\r\n",
      "as he looked in college, the face thin and beardless, almost that of\r\n",
      "a boy, and marked with the nonchalance which always characterised\r\n",
      "him. There are no military trappings, a rough checked shirt, trousers,\r\n",
      "slouching from the waist to campaign boots, hang loosely about the\r\n",
      "attenuated limbs. Soon after that he was carried from the field, not\r\n",
      "wounded, but in utter exhaustion after exposures which no power of\r\n",
      "will could surmount. A few months' respite and he was at his post\r\n",
      "again, intercepting by a swift march Lee's retreating column, almost\r\n",
      "the last warlike act of the Army of the Potomac before Appomattox.\r\n",
      "In this \"Last Leaf\" I do not deal with \"might-have-beens.\" I only\r\n",
      "remember, but we old classmates of Barlow have a feeling that had\r\n",
      "the war continued, if only the bullets to which he was always so\r\n",
      "hospitable had spared him, he would have gone on to the command of\r\n",
      "a corps, and perhaps even to greater distinctions. The photograph\r\n",
      "of Barlow, published after his death in the _Harvard Graduates'\r\n",
      "Magazine_, presents him as he was soon after the war was over. He\r\n",
      "had recovered from the hardships, the face is fairly well rounded\r\n",
      "but still rather that of a beardless, laughing boy than of a man. A\r\n",
      "stranger studying the face would hear with incredulity the story of\r\n",
      "the responsibilities and dangers which that face had confronted. He\r\n",
      "laughed it all off lightly, and that was his way when occasionally in\r\n",
      "his later years he came to our meetings.\r\n",

      "I recall a reunion in 1865, ten years after our graduation. We sat in\r\n",
      "full numbers about a sumptuous banquet at the Parker House in\r\n",
      "Boston, and naturally in that year the returned soldiers were in the\r\n",
      "foreground. In our class were two major-generals, four colonels, a\r\n",
      "distinguished surgeon, and many more of lower rank. Barlow was the\r\n",
      "central figure. Theodore Lyman, who presided, introduced him with a\r\n",

      "such a reception from his old mates; a natural utterance at such a\r\n",

      "that the country had been saved, coupled with modest satisfaction\r\n",
      "that he had borne some part in the great vindication, but that was\r\n",
      "not Barlow's way. He laughed it off lightly, as if it had been a huge\r\n",
      "joke. My classmate, the late Joseph Willard of Boston, told me of a\r\n",
      "reunion of the class at a time much later. The men were discussing\r\n",
      "the stained-glass window which it had been decided should be put in\r\n",
      "Memorial Hall. Since the class had a distinguished military record it\r\n",
      "was felt that there should be martial suggestion in the window and the\r\n",
      "question was what classic warrior should be portrayed. The face, it\r\n",
      "was thought, should have the lineaments of our most famous soldier.\r\n",

      "suggestion that his face should appear, but someone present having\r\n",
      "suggested Alcibiades, probably not seriously as a proper type, that\r\n",

      "Alcibiades, but who should be the dog? Alcibiades had a dog whose\r\n",
      "misfortune in losing his tail has been transmitted through centuries\r\n",

      "of laughter. It was carried through later, however, but Alcibiades and\r\n",
      "the dog do not appear, although Barlow does. No other Harvard soldier\r\n",
      "reached Barlow's eminence, and probably in the whole Army of the\r\n",

      "most picturesque personality, no doubt a better man under his cynical\r\n",

      "The cataclysm of the Civil War, in which as the preceding pages show\r\n",
      "I had been involved, had shaken me in my old moorings. I found myself\r\n",
      "not content in a quiet parish in the Connecticut Valley, and as I\r\n",
      "fared forth was fortunate enough to meet a leader in a remarkable\r\n",
      "personage. Horace Mann was indeed dead, but remained, as he still\r\n",
      "remains, a power. His brilliant gifts and self-consecration made him,\r\n",
      "first, a great educational path-breaker. From that he passed into\r\n",
      "politics, exhibiting in Congress abilities of the highest. Like an\r\n",
      "inconstant lover, however, he harked back to his old attachment, and\r\n",
      "putting aside a fine preferment, the governorship of Massachusetts, it\r\n",
      "was said, forsook his old home for the headship of Antioch College in\r\n",
      "south-western Ohio. I shall not dispute here whether or not he chose\r\n",
      "wisely; much less, how far a lame outcome at Antioch was due to his\r\n",
      "human limitations, and how far to the inevitable conditions. He was a\r\n",
      "potent and unselfish striver for the betterment of men, and his words\r\n",
      "and example still remain an inspiration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My father in these years was a trustee of Antioch College, and this\r\n",
      "brought our household into touch with the illustrious figure of whom\r\n",
      "all men spoke. My memory holds more than a film of him, rather a vivid\r\n",
      "picture, his stately height dominating my boyish inches, as I stood\r\n",
      "in his presence. He was spare to the point of being gaunt, every fibre\r\n",
      "charged with a magnetism which caused a throb in the by-stander. Over\r\n",
      "penetrating eyes hung a beetling brow, and his aggressive, resonant\r\n",
      "voice commanded even in slight utterances. I recall him in a public\r\n",
      "address. The newspapers were full of the Strassburg geese, which,\r\n",
      "nails being driven through their web feet to hold them motionless,\r\n",
      "were fed to develop exaggerated livers,--these for the epicures of\r\n",
      "Paris. \"For health and wholesome appetite,\" he exclaimed, \"I counsel\r\n",
      "you to eschew _les patés de foie gras_, but climb a mountain or\r\n",
      "swing an axe.\" No great sentence in an exhortation to vigorous, manful\r\n",
      "living. But the scornful staccato with which he rolled out the French,\r\n",
      "and the ringing voice and gesture with which he accompanied his\r\n",
      "exhortation, stamped it indelibly. From that day to this, if I have\r\n",
      "felt a beguilement toward the flesh-pots, I still hear the stern tones\r\n",
      "of Horace Mann. In general his eloquence was extraordinary, and I\r\n",
      "suppose few Americans have possessed a power more marked for cutting,\r\n",
      "bitter speech. His invective was masterly, and too often perhaps\r\n",
      "merciless, and it was a weapon he was not slow to wield on occasions\r\n",
      "large and small. In Congress he lashed deservedly low-minded policies\r\n",
      "and misguided blatherskites, but his wrathful outpourings upon pupils\r\n",
      "for some trivial offence were sometimes over-copious. There are Boston\r\n",
      "schoolmasters, still living perhaps, who yet feel a smart from his\r\n",
      "scourge. His personality was so incisive that probably few were in any\r\n",
      "close or long contact with him without a good rasping now and then. My\r\n",
      "father was the most amiable of men, yet even he did not escape. As an\r\n",
      "Antioch trustee he was in charge of funds which were not to be applied\r\n",
      "unless certain conditions were satisfied. Horace Mann demanded the\r\n",
      "money, and it was withheld on occasions and a deluge of ire was poured\r\n",
      "upon my poor father's head. It did not cause him to falter in his\r\n",
      "conviction of Horace Mann's greatness and goodness. Nor has this\r\n",
      "over-ready impetuosity ever caused the world to falter in its\r\n",
      "reverence. He came bringing not peace but a sword, in all the spheres\r\n",
      "in which he moved, and in Horace Mann's world it was a time for the\r\n",
      "sword. He was a path-breaker in regions obstructed by mischievous\r\n",
      "accumulations. There was need of his virile championship, and\r\n",
      "none will say that there was ever in him undue thought of self or\r\n",
      "indifference to the best humanity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My father held fast to the sharp-cornered saint and prophet,\r\n",
      "though somewhat excoriated in the association. He held fast to his\r\n",
      "trusteeship of Antioch; and in 1866, Horace Mann having some years\r\n",
      "before been laid in his untimely grave, he stood in his place as\r\n",
      "president of the college. Through the agency of my dear friends of\r\n",
      "those years, Dr. Henry W. Bellows and Dr. Edward Everett Hale, I was\r\n",
      "to go with him as, so to speak, his under-study, discharging the work\r\n",
      "of English professor and sometimes the duties of preacher. I went\r\n",
      "gladly. The spirit of the dead leader haunted pervasively the shades\r\n",
      "where he had laboured and died. The tradition of Horace Mann\r\n",
      "was paramount among the students, the graduates, and the whole\r\n",
      "environment. I had felt as a boy the spell of his voice and presence\r\n",
      "and knew no hero whom I could follow more cordially. It was a joy to\r\n",
      "become domiciled in the house which had been built for him and where\r\n",
      "he had breathed his last, and to labour day by day along the noble\r\n",
      "lines which he had laid down. This was my post for six years, one of\r\n",
      "which, however, was spent in Europe, in the hope of gaining an added\r\n",
      "fitness for my place.\r\n",

      "drama play a large part. Forty years ago they were unknown or in\r\n",
      "hiding, and it may be claimed that our little fresh-water college\r\n",
      "bore a part in initiating a development that has become memorable and\r\n",
      "widely salutary. In 1872 I wrote out the story of our attempt for\r\n",

      "I have been distressed, dear Fastidiosus, by your remonstrance\r\n",
      "concerning the performance at our college at Sweetbrier of a \"stage\r\n",
      "play.\" You have heard the facts rightly; that it was given under\r\n",
      "the superintendence of the English professor, the evening before\r\n",
      "Commencement, \"with many of the accessories of a theatre.\" You urge\r\n",
      "that it is unprecedented to have at a dignified institution, which\r\n",
      "aims at a high standard, under the superintendence of a professor,\r\n",
      "such a performance; that it excites the prejudices of some people\r\n",
      "against us; and you quote the sharp remarks of _David's Harp_,\r\n",
      "the organ of the Dunkers. You urge that such things can be nothing\r\n",
      "more than the play of boys and girls, and are something worse than\r\n",
      "mere waste of time, for they set young people to thinking of the\r\n",
      "theatre, which is irretrievably sunk and only harmful. In your\r\n",
      "character of trustee, you are sorry it has been done, and beg that it\r\n",
      "may not be done again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I beg you to listen to a patient stating of the case. It is not\r\n",
      "without precedent. When you were at Worms, in Germany, do you remember\r\n",
      "in the Luther Memorial the superb figure of Reuchlin, on one of the\r\n",
      "outer corners? One or two of the statues may be somewhat grander, but\r\n",
      "no other seemed to me so handsome, as it stood colossal on its pillar,\r\n",
      "the scholar's gown falling from the stately shoulders, and the face so\r\n",
      "fine there in the bronze, under the abundant hair and cap. Reuchlin\r\n",
      "is said to be the proper founder of the German drama. Before his time\r\n",
      "there had been, to be sure, some performing of miracle-plays, and\r\n",
      "perhaps things of a different sort. The German literary historians,\r\n",
      "however, make it an era when Reuchlin came as professor to Heidelberg,\r\n",
      "and, in 1497, set up a stage, with students for actors, at the house\r\n",
      "of Johann, Kämmerer von Dalberg. He wrote his plays in Latin. If you\r\n",
      "wish, I can send you their titles. Each act, probably, was prefaced by\r\n",
      "a synopsis in German, and soon translations came into vogue, and were\r\n",
      "performed as well. On that little strip of level which the crags and\r\n",
      "the Neckar make so narrow, collected then, as now, a fair concourse of\r\n",
      "bounding youth. One can easily fancy how, when the prototypes of\r\n",
      "the trim Burschen of to-day stepped out in their representation, the\r\n",
      "applause sounded across to the vineyards about the Heiligenberg and\r\n",
      "Hirschgasse, and how now and then a knight and a dame from the court\r\n",
      "of the Kurfürst came down the Schlossberg to see it all. What Reuchlin\r\n",
      "began, came by no means to a speedy end. In the Jesuit seminaries in\r\n",
      "Germany, in Italy too, and elsewhere, as the Reformation came on, I\r\n",
      "find the boys were acting plays. This feature in the school was\r\n",
      "held out as an attraction to win students; and in Prague the Fathers\r\n",
      "themselves wrote dramas to satirise the Protestants, introducing\r\n",
      "Luther as the comic figure. But what occurred in the Protestant world\r\n",
      "was more noteworthy. As the choral singing of the schoolboys affected\r\n",
      "in an important way the development of music, so the school-plays had\r\n",
      "much to do with the development of the drama. Read Gervinus to see how\r\n",
      "for a century or two it was the schools and universities that remained\r\n",
      "true to a tolerably high standard, while in the world at large all\r\n",
      "nobler ideals were under eclipse. It was jocund Luther himself who\r\n",
      "took it under his especial sanction, as he did the fiddle and the\r\n",
      "dance, in his sweet large-heartedness finding Scriptural precedents\r\n",
      "for it, and encouraging the youths who came trooping to Wittenberg to\r\n",
      "relieve their wrestling with Aristotle and the dreary controversy with\r\n",
      "an occasional play. Melancthon, too, gave the practice encouragement,\r\n",
      "until not only Wittenberg, but the schools of Saxony in general, and\r\n",
      "Thuringia, whose hills were in sight, surpassed all the countries of\r\n",
      "Germany in their attention to plays. In Leipsic, Erfurt, and Magdeburg\r\n",
      "comedies were regularly represented before the schoolmasters. But\r\n",
      "it was at the University of Strassburg, even at the time when the\r\n",
      "unsmiling Calvin was seeking asylum there, that the dramatic life of\r\n",
      "the German seminaries found a splendid culmination. Yearly, in the\r\n",
      "academic theatre, took place a series of representations, by students,\r\n",
      "of marvellous pomp and elaboration. The school and college plays were\r\n",
      "of various characters. Sometimes they were from Terence, Plautus, or\r\n",
      "Aristophanes; sometimes modifications of the ancient mysteries, meant\r\n",
      "to enforce the Evangelical theology; sometimes comedies full of the\r\n",
      "contemporary life. There are several men that have earned mention in\r\n",
      "the history of German literature by writing plays for students.\r\n",
      "The representations became a principal means for celebrating great\r\n",
      "occasions. If special honour was to be done to a festival, or a\r\n",
      "princely visit was expected, the market-place, the Rathhaus, or the\r\n",
      "church was prepared, and it was the professor's or the schoolmaster's\r\n",
      "duty to direct the boys in their performance of a play. We get\r\n",
      "glimpses, in the chronicles, of the circumstances under which the\r\n",
      "representations took place. The magistrates, even the courts, lent\r\n",
      "brilliant dresses. One old writer laments that the ignorant people\r\n",
      "have so little sense for arts of this kind. \"Often tumult and mocking\r\n",
      "are heard, for it is the greatest joy to the rabble if the spectators\r\n",
      "fall down through broken benches.\" The old three-storied stage of the\r\n",
      "mysteries was often retained, with heaven above, earth in the middle\r\n",
      "space, and hell below; where, according to the stage direction of\r\n",
      "the _Golden Legend_, \"the devils walked about and made a great\r\n",
      "noise.\" Lazarus is described as represented in the sixteenth century\r\n",
      "before a hôtel, before which sat the rich man carousing, while\r\n",
      "Abraham, in a parson's coat, looked out of an upper window. This\r\n",
      "rudeness, however, belongs rather to the _Volks-comödie_ than the\r\n",
      "_Schul-comödie_, whose adjuncts were generally far more rational,\r\n",
      "and sometimes even brilliant, as in the Strassburg representations.\r\n",
      "It was only in the seminaries that art was preserved from utter\r\n",
      "decay. One may trace the _Schul-comödie_ until far down in the\r\n",
      "eighteenth century, and in the last mention of it I find appears an\r\n",
      "interesting figure. In 1780, at the military school in Stuttgart the\r\n",
      "birthday of the Duke of Würtemberg was celebrated by a performance\r\n",
      "of Goethe's _Clavigo_. The leading part was taken by a youth\r\n",
      "of twenty-one, with high cheek-bones, a broad, low, Greek brow\r\n",
      "above straight eyebrows, a prominent nose, and lips nervous with an\r\n",
      "extraordinary energy. The German narrator says he played the part\r\n",
      "\"abominably, shrieking, roaring, unmannerly to a laughable degree.\" It\r\n",
      "was the young Schiller, wild as a pythoness upon her tripod, with the\r\n",
      "_Robbers_, which became famous in the following year.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I do not mean, Fastidiosus, to cite only German precedents, nor to\r\n",
      "uphold the college drama with the names of Reuchlin, Melancthon, and\r\n",
      "Luther alone, majestic though they are. In the University of Paris\r\n",
      "the custom of acting plays was one of high antiquity. In 1392 the\r\n",
      "schoolboys of Angiers performed _Robin and Marian_, \"as was their\r\n",
      "annual custom\"; and in 1477 the scholars of Pontoise represented \"a\r\n",
      "certain moralitie or farce, as is their custom.\" In 1558 the comedies\r\n",
      "of Jacques Grévin were acted at the College of Beauvais at Paris; but\r\n",
      "it is in the next century that we come upon the most interesting\r\n",
      "case. In the days of Louis XIV. the girls' school at St. Cyr, of which\r\n",
      "Madame de Maintenon was patroness, was, in one way and another, the\r\n",
      "object of much public attention. Mademoiselle de Caylus, niece of\r\n",
      "Madame de Maintenon, who became famous among the women of charming wit\r\n",
      "and grace who distinguished the time, was a pupil at St. Cyr, and in\r\n",
      "her memoirs gives a pleasant sketch of her school life. With the rest,\r\n",
      "\"Madame de Brinon,\" she says,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  first superior of St. Cyr, loved verse and the drama;\r\n",
      "  and in default of the pieces of Corneille and Racine,\r\n",
      "  which she did not dare to have represented, she\r\n",
      "  composed plays herself. It is to her, and her taste\r\n",
      "  for the stage, that the world owes _Esther_ and\r\n",
      "  _Athalie_, which Racine wrote for the girls of St.\r\n",
      "  Cyr. Madame de Maintenon wished to see one of\r\n",
      "  Madame de Brinon's pieces. She found it such as\r\n",
      "  it was, that is to say, so bad that she begged to\r\n",
      "  have no more such played, and that instead some\r\n",
      "  beautiful piece of Corneille or Racine should be\r\n",
      "  selected, choosing such as contained least about\r\n",
      "  love. These young girls, therefore, undertook the\r\n",
      "  rendering of _Cinna_, quite passably for children who\r\n",
      "  had been trained for the stage only by an old nun.\r\n",
      "  They then played _Andromaque_; and, whether it was\r\n",

      "  fear that this amusement would fill them with sentiments\r\n",
      "  the reverse of those which she wished to inspire.\r\n",
      "  However, as she was persuaded that amusements\r\n",
      "  of this sort were good for youth, she wrote\r\n",

      "  moments of leisure, some sort of moral or historic\r\n",
      "  poem, from which love should be entirely banished,\r\n",
      "  and in which he need not believe that his reputation\r\n",

      "  commission was delicate for a man who, like him, had\r\n",

      "Cambridge, when adorned for the Christmas plays, surpasses its\r\n",
      "ordinary appearance. On these occasions, the most dignified personages\r\n",
      "of the University were invited, and at length, as was the German\r\n",
      "fashion, the representation of plays was adopted as part of the\r\n",
      "entertainment of visitors. In 1564, Queen Elizabeth visited Cambridge,\r\n",
      "and the picture transmitted to us of the festivities is full of\r\n",
      "brilliant lights. With the rest, five doctors of the University\r\n",
      "selected from all the colleges the youths of best appearance and\r\n",
      "address, who acted before the queen a series of plays of varied\r\n",
      "character, sometimes grave, sometimes gay, in part of classic, in\r\n",
      "part of contemporary authorship. The theatre for the time was no other\r\n",
      "place than the beautiful King's College chapel, across the entire\r\n",
      "width of which the stage was built. For light, the yeomen of the royal\r\n",
      "guard, their fine figures in brilliant uniform, stood in line from end\r\n",
      "to end of the chapel, each holding a torch. It was a superb scene, no\r\n",
      "doubt; the torches throwing their wavering glare against the tracery\r\n",
      "and the low, pointed arch of window and portal, so beautiful in this\r\n",
      "chapel, in the ruins of Kenilworth, or wherever it appears; the\r\n",
      "great space filled with the splendour that Roger Ascham thought so\r\n",
      "wonderful; and, among the glitter, the troop of handsome youths doing\r\n",
      "their best to please the sovereign. Froude gives a story from De\r\n",
      "Silva, the Spanish ambassador, which reflects so well the character\r\n",
      "of the time, and shows up boyish human nature with such amusing\r\n",
      "faithfulness, that I cannot omit it. When all was over, the students\r\n",
      "would not let well enough alone, but begged the tired queen to see one\r\n",
      "more play of their own devising, which they felt sure would give her\r\n",
      "special pleasure. The queen, however, departed, going ten miles on\r\n",
      "her journey to the seat of one of her nobility. The persistent boys\r\n",
      "followed her, and she granted them permission to perform before her\r\n",
      "in the evening. What should the unconscionable dogs do but drag in\r\n",
      "the bitter trouble of the time, and heedlessly trample on the queen's\r\n",
      "prejudices. The actors entered dressed like the bishops of Queen Mary,\r\n",
      "who were then in prison. Bonner carried a lamb, at which he rolled his\r\n",
      "eyes and gnashed his teeth. A dog brought up the rear, carrying the\r\n",
      "Host in his mouth. What further was to follow no one can say. The\r\n",
      "queen, who was never more than half a Protestant, and clung to the\r\n",
      "mass all the more devoutly because she was obliged to resign so much,\r\n",
      "filled the air with her indignation. She swore good round oaths, we\r\n",
      "may be sure, and left the room in a rage. The lights were put out, and\r\n",

      "of Christ Church. The room is very fine in its proportions and\r\n",
      "decoration, and hung with the portraits of the multitude of brilliant\r\n",
      "men who in their young days were Christ Church men. During all the\r\n",
      "centuries that the rich dark stain has been gathering upon the carved\r\n",
      "oak in the ceiling and wainscot, it has been the scene of banquets and\r\n",
      "pageants without number, at which the most illustrious characters\r\n",
      "of English history have figured. I doubt, however, if any of its\r\n",
      "associations are finer than those connected with the student plays\r\n",
      "that have been performed here. Passing over occasions of this kind\r\n",
      "of less interest of which I find mention, in 1566 Elizabeth visited\r\n",
      "Oxford, to do honour to whom in this great hall of Christ Church\r\n",
      "plays were given. Oxford was determined not to be outdone by what had\r\n",
      "happened at Cambridge two years before. From the accounts, the delight\r\n",
      "of the hearty queen must have been intense; and as she was never\r\n",
      "afraid to testify most frankly her genuine feelings, we may be sure\r\n",
      "the Oxford authorities and their pupils must have presented their\r\n",
      "entertainments with extraordinary pomp. The plays, as at Cambridge,\r\n",
      "were of various character, but the one that gave especial pleasure was\r\n",
      "an English piece having the same subject as the _Knighte's Tale\r\n",
      "of Chaucer_, and called _Palamon and Arcite_. It would be\r\n",
      "pleasant to know that the poet followed as far as possible the words\r\n",
      "of Chaucer. There is a fine incident narrated connected with the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "a \"cry of hounds\" was counterfeited under the windows in the\r\n",
      "quadrangle. The students present thought it was a real chase, and\r\n",
      "were seized with a sudden transport to join the hunters. At this, the\r\n",
      "delighted queen, sitting in stiff ruff and farthingale among her maids\r\n",
      "of honour, burst out above all the tumult with \"Oh, excellent! These\r\n",
      "boys, in very truth, are ready to leap out of the windows to follow\r\n",
      "the hounds!\" When the play was over, the queen called up the poet,\r\n",

      "When, forty years after, in 1605, the dull James came to Oxford, the\r\n",
      "poor boys had a harder time. A thing very noteworthy happened when\r\n",
      "the king entered the city in his progress from Woodstock. If Warton's\r\n",
      "notion is correct, scarcely the iron cross in the pavement that marks\r\n",
      "the spot where the bishops were burned, or the solemn chamber in which\r\n",
      "they were tried, yea, scarcely Guy Fawkes's lantern, which they show\r\n",
      "you at the Bodleian, or the Brazen Nose itself, are memorials as\r\n",
      "interesting as the archway leading into the quadrangle of St. John's\r\n",
      "College, under whose carving, quaint and graceful, one now gets the\r\n",
      "lovely glimpse into the green and bloom of the gardens at the back. At\r\n",
      "this gate, three youths dressed like witches met the king, declaring\r\n",
      "they were the same that once met Macbeth and Banquo, prophesying a\r\n",
      "kingdom to one and to the other a generation of monarchs, that they\r\n",
      "now appeared to show the confirmation of the prediction. Warton's\r\n",
      "conjecture is that Shakespeare heard of this, or perhaps was himself\r\n",
      "in the crowd that watched the boys as they came whirling out in their\r\n",
      "weird dance, and that then and there was conceived what was to become\r\n",

      "King James, however, received it all coldly. The University, kindled\r\n",
      "by the traditions of Elizabeth's visit, did its best. Leland gives a\r\n",
      "glimpse of the stage arrangements in Christ Church Hall. Towards the\r\n",
      "end \"was a scene like a wall, painted and adorned by stately pillars,\r\n",
      "which pillars would turn about, by reason whereof, with the help of\r\n",
      "other painted cloths, their stage did vary three times.\" But the\r\n",
      "king liked the scholastic hair-splitting with which he was elsewhere\r\n",
      "entertained better than the plays. In Christ Church Hall he yawned\r\n",
      "and even went to sleep, saying it was all mere childish amusement. In\r\n",
      "fact, the poor boys had to put up with even a worse rebuff; the\r\n",
      "king spoke many words of dislike, and when, in one of the plays, a\r\n",
      "pastoral, certain characters came in somewhat scantily attired, the\r\n",
      "queen and maids of honour took great offence, in which the king, who\r\n",
      "was not ordinarily over-delicate, concurred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The practice of acting plays prevailed in the schools as well. The\r\n",
      "visitor to Windsor will remember in what peace, as seen from the great\r\n",
      "tower, beyond the smooth, dark Thames, the buildings of Eton lie\r\n",
      "among the trees. Crossing into the old town and entering the school\r\n",
      "precincts, where the stone stairways are worn by so many generations\r\n",
      "of young feet, and where on the play-ground the old elms shadow turf\r\n",
      "where so many soldiers and statesmen have been trained to struggle in\r\n",
      "larger fields, there is nothing after all finer than the great hall.\r\n",
      "In every age since the wars of the Roses, it has buzzed with the\r\n",
      "boisterous life of the privileged boys of England, who have come\r\n",
      "up afterward by the hundred to be historic men. There are still the\r\n",
      "fireplaces with the monogram of Henry VI., the old stained glass,\r\n",
      "the superb wood carving, the dais at the end. If there were no other\r\n",
      "memory connected with the magnificent hall, it would be enough that\r\n",
      "here, about 1550, was performed by the Eton boys, _Ralph Roister\r\n",
      "Bolster_, the first proper English comedy, written by Nicholas\r\n",
      "Udal, then head-master, for the Christmas holidays. He had the name\r\n",

      "refectory, and handsomely proportioned and decorated. A wide stage\r\n",
      "runs across the end. We found some ample curtains of crimson, set off\r\n",
      "with a heavy yellow silken border of quite rich material, which had\r\n",
      "been used to drape a window that had disappeared in the course of\r\n",
      "repairs. This, stretched from side to side, made a wall of brilliant\r\n",

      "have had a thought of Antwerp. The stage is the one thing in the world\r\n",

      "shams here. The costumes were devised with constant reference to\r\n",
      "Charles Knight, and, to the eye, were of the gayest silk, satin, and\r\n",
      "velvet. There was, moreover, a profusion of jewels, which, for all\r\n",

      "diamond, as you see it suspended above the imperial crowns in the\r\n",

      "attended to. Pedro was in white and gold, Claudio in blue and silver,\r\n",
      "Leonato in red; while our handsome Benedick, a youth of dark Italian\r\n",
      "favour, in doublet of orange, a broad black velvet sash, and scarlet\r\n",
      "cloak, shone like a bird of paradise.\r\n",

      "There was a garden-scene, in the foreground of which, where the\r\n",
      "eyes of the spectators were near enough to discriminate, were rustic\r\n",
      "baskets with geraniums, fuchsias, and cactuses, to give a southern\r\n",
      "air. In the middle distance, armfuls of honeysuckle in full bloom\r\n",
      "were brought in and twined about white pilasters. There was an arbour\r\n",
      "overhung with heavy masses of the trumpet-creeper. A tall column or\r\n",
      "two surmounted with graceful garden-vases were covered about with\r\n",
      "raspberry-vines, the stems of brilliant scarlet showing among the\r\n",
      "green. A thick clump of dogwood, whose large white blossoms could\r\n",
      "easily pass for magnolias, gave background. The green was lit with\r\n",
      "showy colour of every sort,--handfuls of nasturtiums, now and then a\r\n",
      "peony, larkspurs for blue, patches of poppies, and in the garden-vases\r\n",
      "high on the pillars (the imposition!) clusters of pink hollyhocks\r\n",
      "which were meant to pass for oleander-blossoms, and did, still, wet\r\n",
      "with the drops of the afternoon shower, which had not dried away when\r\n",
      "all was in place. When it comes to rain and dewdrops, dear Dr. Holmes,\r\n",
      "a \"fresh-water college\" has an advantage. First, it was given under\r\n",
      "gas; then, the hall being darkened, a magnesium-light gave a moon-like\r\n",
      "radiance, in which the dew on the buds glistened, and the mignonette\r\n",
      "seemed to exhale a double perfume, and a dreamy melody of Mendelssohn\r\n",
      "sung by two sweet girl-voices floated out about the \"pleached bower,\"\r\n",
      "like a song of nightingales. Then toward the end came the scene of the\r\n",
      "chapel and Hero's tomb. No lovelier form was ever sculptured than that\r\n",
      "of the beautiful Queen Louisa of Prussia, as she lies in the mausoleum\r\n",
      "at Charlottenburg, carved by Rauch, asleep on the tomb in white\r\n",
      "purity. To the eye, our Hero's tomb was just such a block of spotless\r\n",
      "marble seen against a background of black, with just such a fair\r\n",
      "figure recumbent upon it, whose palms and lids and draping the chisel\r\n",
      "of an artist seemed to have folded and closed and hung,--all idealised\r\n",
      "again by the magic of the magnesium-light. As the crimson curtain was\r\n",
      "drawn apart, an organ sounded, and a far-away choir sent into the hush\r\n",
      "the _Ave Verum_ of Mozart, low-breathed and solemn.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "THE GIANT IN THE SPIKED HELMET\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In January of 1870, having decided to teach rather than preach, I\r\n",
      "embarked for Germany to enjoy a year of foreign study. Like Western\r\n",
      "professors in general (to borrow the witticism of President Eliot)\r\n",
      "I occupied not so much a chair as a sofa, and felt that I needed\r\n",
      "enlargement for the performance of my functions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I think I saw a certain caricature first in Munich at the end of July,\r\n",
      "then in two or three Swiss cities, then in Paris at the end of August,\r\n",
      "then in Brussels and London; for it was popular, and the print-shops\r\n",
      "had it everywhere. It was a map of Europe where the different\r\n",
      "countries were represented by comical figures, each meant to hit off\r\n",
      "the peculiarities of the nation it stood for, according to popular\r\n",
      "apprehension. For Prussia there was an immense giant, one of whose\r\n",
      "knees was on the stomach of Austria represented as a lank figure\r\n",
      "utterly prostrate, while the other foot threatened to crush\r\n",
      "South-western Germany. One hand menaced France, whose outline the\r\n",
      "designer had managed to give rudely in the figure of a Zouave in\r\n",
      "a fierce attitude; and the other was thrust toward Russia, a huge\r\n",
      "colossus with Calmuck dress, and features. The most conspicuous thing\r\n",
      "in the giant's dress was a helmet with a spike projecting from the\r\n",
      "top, much too large for the head of the wearer, and therefore falling\r\n",
      "over his eyes until they were almost blinded by it. The style of the\r\n",
      "helmet was that of the usual head-dress of the Prussian soldier. The\r\n",
      "caricature generally was not bad, and the hit at Prussia, half crushed\r\n",
      "and blinded under the big helmet, was particularly good. Throughout\r\n",
      "her whole history Prussia is either at war, or getting ready for war,\r\n",
      "or lying exhausted through wounds and recovering strength. In Prussia\r\n",
      "you found things of pugnacious suggestion always, and in the most\r\n",
      "incongruous connections. Study the schools, and there was something\r\n",
      "to call up the soldier. Study the church, and even there was a burly\r\n",
      "polemic quality which you can trace back from to-day to the time when\r\n",
      "the Prussian bishops were fighting knights. Study the people in their\r\n",
      "quietest moods, in their homes, among their recreations, indeed, among\r\n",
      "the graves of those they honour as the greatest heroes, and you found\r\n",
      "the same overhanging shadow of war. This predominant martial quality\r\n",
      "showed itself in ways sometimes brutal, sometimes absurd, sometimes\r\n",
      "sublime.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I visited Prussia at a time of entire peace, for at my departure I\r\n",
      "crossed the frontier (or that of the North German Confederation, the\r\n",
      "whole of which, for convenience's sake, we will call Prussia) on the\r\n",
      "very day when King William was shouldering aside so roughly at Ems\r\n",
      "Benedetti and the famous French demands. The things to which I gave\r\n",
      "attention for the most part were the things which belong to peace;\r\n",
      "yet as I arrange my recollections I find that something military runs\r\n",
      "through the whole of them. As one's letters when he has read them are\r\n",
      "filed away on the pointed wire standing on the desk, so as regards my\r\n",
      "Prussian experiences everything seems to have been filed away on the\r\n",
      "spike of a helmet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Going out early one May morning to get my first sight of Berlin, I\r\n",
      "stood presently in a broad avenue. In the centre ran a wide promenade\r\n",
      "lined with tall, full-foliaged trees, with a crowded roadway on each\r\n",
      "side bordered by stately buildings. Close by me a colossal equestrian\r\n",
      "statue in bronze towered up till the head of the rider was on a level\r\n",
      "with the eaves of the houses. The rider was in cocked hat, booted and\r\n",
      "spurred, the eye turned sharp to the left as if reconnoitring, the\r\n",
      "attitude alert, life-like, as if he might dismount any moment if he\r\n",
      "chose. In the distance down the long perspective of trees was a lofty\r\n",
      "gate supported by columns, with a figure of Victory on the top in a\r\n",
      "chariot drawn by horses. Close at hand again, under the porch of a\r\n",
      "square strong structure, stood two straight sentinels. An officer\r\n",
      "passed in a carriage on the farther side of the avenue. Instantly\r\n",
      "the two sentinels stepped back in concert as if the same clock-work\r\n",
      "regulated their movements, brought their shining pieces with perfect\r\n",
      "precision to the \"present,\" stood for an instant as if hewn from\r\n",
      "stone, the spiked helmets above the blond faces inclining backward at\r\n",
      "the same angle, then precisely together fell into the old position.\r\n",
      "The street was \"Unter den Linden.\" The tall statue was the memorial\r\n",
      "of Frederick the Great. The gate down the long vista was the\r\n",
      "Brandenburger Thor, surmounted by the charioted Victory which Napoleon\r\n",
      "carried to Paris after Jena and which came back after Waterloo. The\r\n",
      "solid building was the palace of iron-grey old King William; and when\r\n",
      "the clock-work sentinels went through their salute, I got my first\r\n",
      "sight of that famous Prussian discipline, against which before\r\n",
      "the summer was through supple France was to crush its teeth all to\r\n",
      "fragments, like a viper that has incautiously bitten at a file.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There never was a place with aspect more military than Berlin even\r\n",
      "in peaceful times. In many quarters towered great barracks for the\r\n",
      "troops. The public memorials were almost exclusively in honour of\r\n",
      "great soldiers. There were tall columns, too, to commemorate victories\r\n",
      "or the crushing out of revolutionary spirit; rarely, indeed, in\r\n",
      "comparison, a statue to a man of scientific or literary or artistic\r\n",
      "eminence. Frederick sits among the tree-tops of Unter den Linden, and\r\n",
      "about his pedestal are life-size figures of the men of his age whom\r\n",
      "Prussia holds most worthy of honour. At the four corners ride the\r\n",
      "Duke of Brunswick and cunning Prince Heinrich, old Ziethen and fiery\r\n",
      "Seydlitz. Between are a score or more of soldiers of lesser note, only\r\n",
      "soldiers, spurred and sabre-girt,--except at the very back; and there,\r\n",
      "just where the tail of Frederick's horse droops over, stand--whom\r\n",
      "think you?--no others than Leasing, critic and poet, most gifted and\r\n",
      "famous; and Kant, peer of Plato and Bacon, one of the most gifted\r\n",
      "brains of all time. Just standing room for them among the hoofs and\r\n",
      "uniforms at the tail of Frederick's horse! Every third man one met in\r\n",
      "Berlin was a soldier off duty. Batteries of steel guns rolled by at\r\n",
      "any time, obedient to their bugles. Squadrons of Uhlans in uniforms of\r\n",
      "green and red, the pennons fluttering from the ends of their lances,\r\n",
      "rode up to salute the king. Each day at noon, through the roar of\r\n",
      "the streets, swelled the finest martial music; first a grand sound of\r\n",
      "trumpets, then a deafening roll from a score of brazen drums. A heavy\r\n",
      "detachment of infantry wheeled out from some barracks, ranks of strong\r\n",
      "brown-haired young men stretching from sidewalk to sidewalk, neat in\r\n",
      "every thread and accoutrement, with the German gift for music all, as\r\n",
      "the stride told with which they beat out upon the pavement the rhythm\r\n",
      "of the march, dropping sections at intervals to do the unbroken guard\r\n",
      "duty at the various posts. Frequently whole army corps gathered to\r\n",
      "manoeuvre at the vast parade-ground by the Kreuzberg in the outskirts.\r\n",
      "On Unter den Linden is a strong square building, erected, after the\r\n",
      "model of a Roman fortress, to be the quarters of the main guard. The\r\n",
      "officers on duty at Berlin came here daily at noon to hear military\r\n",
      "music and for a half-hour's talk. They came always in full uniform, a\r\n",
      "collection of the most brilliant colours, hussars in red, blue, green,\r\n",
      "and black, the king's body-guard in white with braid of yellow and\r\n",
      "silver, in helmets that flashed as if made from burnished gold,\r\n",
      "crested with an eagle with out-spread wings. The men themselves\r\n",
      "were the handsomest one can see; figures of the finest symmetry and\r\n",
      "stature, trained by every athletic exercise, and the faces often so\r\n",
      "young and beautiful! Counts and barons were there from Pomerania and\r\n",
      "old Brandenburg, where the Prussian spirit is most intense, and no\r\n",
      "nobility is nobler or prouder. They were blue-eyed and fair-haired\r\n",
      "descendants perhaps of the chieftains that helped Herman overcome\r\n",
      "Varus, and whose names may be found five hundred years back among the\r\n",
      "Deutsch Ritters that conquered Northern Europe from heathendom, and\r\n",
      "thence all the way down to now, occurring in martial and princely\r\n",
      "connection. It was the acme of martial splendour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But how do you bear it all?\" you say to your Prussian friend, with\r\n",
      "whom you stand looking on at the base of Billow's statue. \"Is not this\r\n",
      "enormous preparation for bloodshed something dreadful? Then the tax\r\n",
      "on the country to support it all, the withdrawing of such a multitude\r\n",
      "from the employments of peace.\" Your friend, who had been a soldier\r\n",
      "himself, would answer: \"We bear it because we must. It is the price\r\n",
      "of our existence, and we have got used to it; and, after all, with the\r\n",
      "hardship come great benefits. Every able-bodied young Prussian must\r\n",
      "serve as a soldier, be he noble or low-born, rich or poor. If he\r\n",
      "cannot read or write, he must learn. He must be punctual, neat,\r\n",
      "temperate, and so gets valuable habits. His body is trained to be\r\n",
      "strong and supple. Shoemaker and banker's son, count, tailor, and\r\n",
      "farmer march together, and community of feeling comes about. The great\r\n",
      "traditions of Prussian history are the atmosphere they breathe, and\r\n",
      "they become patriotic. The soldier must put off marrying, perhaps half\r\n",
      "forget his trade, and come into life poor; for who can save on nine\r\n",
      "cents a day, with board and clothes? But it is a wonder if he is not\r\n",
      "a healthy, well-trained, patriotic man.\" So talked your Prussian; and\r\n",
      "however much of a peace-man you might be, you could not help owning\r\n",
      "there was some truth in it. If you bought a suit of clothes,\r\n",
      "the tailor jumped up from his cross-legged position, prompt and\r\n",
      "full-chested, with tan on his face he got in campaigning; and it is\r\n",
      "hard to say he had lost more than he gained in his army training. If\r\n",
      "you went into a school, the teacher, with a close-clipped beard and\r\n",
      "vigorous gait, who had a scar on his face from Königgrätz, seemed none\r\n",
      "the worse for it, though he might have read a few books the less and\r\n",
      "lost his student pallor. At any rate, bad or good, so it was; and so,\r\n",
      "said the Prussian, it must be. Eternal vigilance and preparation! I\r\n",
      "went in one day to the arsenal. The flags which Prussian armies had\r\n",
      "taken from almost every nation in Europe were ranged against the\r\n",
      "walls by the hundred; shot-shattered rags of silk, white standards of\r\n",
      "Austria embroidered with gold, Bavaria's blue checker, above all the\r\n",
      "great Napoleonic symbol, the N surrounded by its wreath. This was the\r\n",
      "memorable tapestry that hung the walls, and opposite glittered the\r\n",
      "waiting barrels and bayonets till one could almost believe them\r\n",
      "conscious, and burning to do as much as the flintlocks that won\r\n",
      "the standards. There was a needle-gun there or somewhere for every\r\n",
      "able-bodied man, and somewhere else uniform and equipments. When I\r\n",
      "landed in February on the bank of the Weser, the most prominent\r\n",
      "object was the redoubt with the North German flag. When in midsummer\r\n",
      "I crossed the Bavarian frontier among a softer people, the last marked\r\n",
      "object was the old stronghold of Coburg, battered by siege after siege\r\n",
      "for a thousand years. It was the spiked helmet at the entrance and\r\n",
      "again at the exit; and from entrance to exit, few places or times were\r\n",
      "free from some martial suggestion. It was a nation that had come to\r\n",
      "power mainly through war, and been schooled into the belief that its\r\n",
      "mailed fists alone could guarantee its life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I visited a primary school. The little boys of six came with knapsacks\r\n",
      "strapped to their backs for their books and dinners, instead of\r\n",
      "satchels. At the tap of a bell they formed themselves into column\r\n",
      "and marched like little veterans to the schoolroom door. I visited\r\n",
      "a school for boys of thirteen or fourteen. Casting my eyes into\r\n",
      "the yard, I saw the spiked helmet in the shape of the half-military\r\n",
      "manoeuvres of a class which the teacher of gymnastics was training for\r\n",
      "the severer drill of five or six years later. I visited the \"prima,\"\r\n",
      "or upper class of a gymnasium, and here was the spiked helmet in a\r\n",
      "connection that seemed at first rather irreverent. After all, however,\r\n",
      "it was only thoroughly Prussian, and deserved to be looked upon as\r\n",
      "a comical incongruity rather than gravely blamed. A row of cheap\r\n",
      "pictures hung side by side upon the wall. First Luther, the rougher\r\n",
      "characteristics of the well-known portrait somewhat exaggerated. The\r\n",
      "shoulders were even larger than common. The bony buttresses of the\r\n",
      "forehead over the eyes, too, as they rose above the strong lower face,\r\n",
      "were emphasised, looking truly as though, if tongue and pen failed to\r\n",
      "make a way, the shoulders could push one, and, if worse came to worst,\r\n",
      "the head would butt one. Next to Luther was a head of Christ; then in\r\n",
      "the same line, with nothing in the position or quality of the pictures\r\n",
      "to indicate that the subjects were any less esteemed, a row of royal\r\n",
      "personages, whose military trappings were made particularly plain.\r\n",
      "It was all characteristic enough. The Reformer's figure stood for the\r\n",
      "stalwart Protestantism of the Prussian character, still living and\r\n",
      "militant in a way hard for us to imagine; the portraits of the royal\r\n",
      "soldiers stood for its combative loyalty, ready to meet anything for\r\n",
      "king and fatherland; and the head of Christ for its zealous faith,\r\n",
      "which, however it may have cooled away among some classes of the\r\n",
      "people, was still intense in the nation at large. I visited the best\r\n",
      "school for girls in Berlin, and it was singular to find the spiked\r\n",
      "helmet, among those retiring maidens even, and this time not hung upon\r\n",
      "the wall nor outside in the yard. The teacher of the most interesting\r\n",
      "class I visited--a class in German literature--was a man of\r\n",
      "forty-five, of straight, soldierly bearing, a grey, martial moustache,\r\n",
      "and energetic eye. He told me, as we walked together in the hall,\r\n",
      "waiting for the exercise to commence, that he had been a soldier, and\r\n",
      "it so happened that among the ballads in the lesson for that day was\r\n",
      "one in honour of the Prussian troops at Rossbach. Over this the old\r\n",
      "soldier broke out into an animated lecture, which grew more and more\r\n",
      "earnest as he went forward; he showed how the idea of faithfulness to\r\n",
      "duty had become obscured, but was enforced again by the philosopher\r\n",
      "Kant in his teaching, and then brought into practice by the great\r\n",
      "Frederick. The veteran plainly thought there was no duty higher than\r\n",
      "that owed to the _schwarzer Adler_, the black eagle of Prussia.\r\n",
      "Then came an account of the French horse before Rossbach; how they\r\n",
      "rode out from Weimar, the troopers, before they went, ripping open the\r\n",
      "beds on which they had slept and scattering the feathers to the wind\r\n",
      "to plague the housewives,--a piece of ruthlessness that came home\r\n",
      "thoroughly to the young housekeepers; then how _der alte\r\n",
      "Fritz_, lying in wait behind Janus Hill, with General Seydlitz and\r\n",

      "The soldier was in a fever of patriotism and rage against the French\r\n",
      "before his description was finished, and the faces of the girls\r\n",
      "kindled in response. \"They will some time,\" I thought, \"be lovers,\r\n",

      "Admirable schools they all were, the presence of the spiked helmet\r\n",
      "notwithstanding, and crowning them in the great Prussian educational\r\n",
      "system came the famous universities. That at Berlin counted its\r\n",
      "students by thousands, its professors by hundreds. There was no branch\r\n",
      "of human knowledge without its teacher. One could study Egyptian\r\n",
      "hieroglyphics or the Assyrian arrow-head inscriptions. A new pimple\r\n",
      "could hardly break out on the blotched face of the moon, without\r\n",
      "a lecture from a professor next day to explain the theory of its\r\n",
      "development. The poor earthquakes were hardly left to shake in peace\r\n",
      "an out-of-the-way strip of South American coast or Calabrian plain,\r\n",
      "but a German professor violated their privacy, undertook to see whence\r\n",
      "they came and whither they went, and even tried to predict when they\r\n",
      "would go to shaking again. The vast building of the University stood\r\n",
      "on Unter den Linden, opposite the palace of the king. Large as it was,\r\n",
      "its halls were crowded at the end of every hour by the thousand or two\r\n",
      "of young men, who presently disappeared within the lecture-rooms.\r\n",
      "Here in past years had been Hegel and Fichte, the brothers Grimm, the\r\n",
      "brothers Humboldt, Niebuhr, and Carl Ritter. Here in my time, were\r\n",
      "Lepsius and Curtius, Virchow and Hoffman, Ranke and Mommsen,--the\r\n",
      "world's first scholars in the past and present. The student selected\r\n",
      "his lecturers, then went day by day through the semester to the plain\r\n",
      "lecture-rooms, taking notes diligently at benches which had been\r\n",
      "whittled well by his predecessors, and where he too most likely\r\n",

      "Where could one find the spiked helmet in the midst of the scholastic\r\n",
      "quiet and diligence of a German university? It was visible enough in\r\n",
      "more ways than one. Here was one manifestation. Run down the long list\r\n",
      "of professors and teachers in the _Anzeiger_, and you would find\r\n",
      "somewhere in the list the _Fechtmeister_, instructor in fighting,\r\n",
      "master of the sword exercise, and he was pretty sure to be one of\r\n",
      "the busiest men in the company. To most German students, a sword, or\r\n",
      "_Schläger_, was as necessary as pipe or beer-mug; not a slender\r\n",
      "fencing-foil, with a button on the point, and slight enough to snap\r\n",
      "with a vigorous thrust, but a stout blade of tempered steel, ground\r\n",
      "sharp. With these weapons the students perpetrated savageries,\r\n",
      "almost unrebuked, which struck an American with horror. Duels were\r\n",
      "of frequent occurrence, taking place sometimes at places and on days\r\n",
      "regularly set apart for the really bloody work. The fighters were\r\n",
      "partially protected by a sort of armour, and the wounds inflicted were\r\n",
      "generally more ghastly than dangerous; though a son of Bismarck was\r\n",
      "said to have been nearly killed at Bonn a few years before, and there\r\n",
      "was sometimes serious maiming. Perhaps one may say it was nothing but\r\n",
      "very rough play, but it was the play of young savages, whose sport was\r\n",
      "nothing to them without a dash of cruel rage. The practice dates from\r\n",
      "the time when the Germans wore wolf-skins, and were barbarians roaring\r\n",
      "in their woods. Perhaps the university authorities found it too\r\n",
      "inveterate a thing to be done away with; perhaps, too, they felt,\r\n",
      "thinking as it were under their spiked helmets, that after all it had\r\n",
      "a value, making the young men cool in danger and accustoming them to\r\n",
      "weapons. We, after all, cannot say too much. Often our young American\r\n",
      "students in Germany take to the _Schläger_ as gracefully and\r\n",
      "naturally as game-cocks to spurs. The most noted duellist at one of\r\n",
      "the universities that winter was a burly young Westerner, who had\r\n",
      "things at first all his own way. A still burlier Prussian from\r\n",
      "Tübingen, however, appeared at last, and so carved our valiant\r\n",
      "borderer's face, that thereafter with its criss-cross scars it looked\r\n",
      "like a well-frequented skating-ground. Football, too, in America\r\n",
      "probably kills and maims more in a year than all the German duels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To crown all, the schools and University at Berlin were magnificently\r\n",
      "supplemented in the great Museum, a vast collection, where one might\r\n",
      "study the rise and progress of civilisation in every race of past ages\r\n",
      "that has had a history, the present condition of perhaps every people,\r\n",
      "civilised or wild, under the sun. In one great hall you were among the\r\n",
      "satin garments and lacquered furniture of China; in another there was\r\n",
      "the seal-skin work of the Esquimaux stitched with sinew. Now you sat\r\n",
      "in a Tartar tent, now among the war-clubs, the conch-shell trumpets,\r\n",
      "the drums covered with human skin of the Polynesians. Here it was\r\n",
      "the feathery finery of the Caribs, here the idols and trinkets of the\r\n",
      "negroes of Soudan. There too, in still other halls, was the history\r\n",
      "of our own race; the maces the Teutons and Norsemen fought with, the\r\n",
      "torcs of twisted gold they wore about their necks, the sacrificial\r\n",
      "knives that slew the victims on the altars of Odin; so, too, what our\r\n",
      "fathers have carved and spun, moulded, cast, and portrayed, until\r\n",
      "we took up the task of life. In another place you found the great\r\n",
      "collection made in Egypt by Lepsius. The visitor stood within the\r\n",
      "facsimile of a temple on the banks of the Nile. On the walls and\r\n",
      "lotus-shaped columns were processions of dark figures at the loom,\r\n",
      "at the work of irrigation, marching as soldiers, or mourners at\r\n",
      "funerals,--exact copies of the original delineations. There were\r\n",
      "sphinx and obelisk, coffins of kings, mummies of priest and chieftain,\r\n",
      "the fabrics they wore, the gems they cut, the scrolls they engrossed,\r\n",
      "the tomb in which they were buried. Stepping into another section, you\r\n",
      "were in Assyria, with the alabaster lions and plumed genii of the men\r\n",
      "of Nineveh and Babylon. The walls again were brilliant, now with the\r\n",
      "splendour of the palaces of Nebuchadnezzar; the captives building\r\n",
      "temples, the chivalry sacking cities, the princes on their thrones.\r\n",
      "Here too was Etruria revealed in her sculpture and painted vases; and\r\n",
      "here too the whole story of Greece. Passing through these wonderful\r\n",
      "halls, you reviewed a thousand years and more, almost from the epoch\r\n",
      "of Cadmus, through the vicissitudes of empire and servitude, until\r\n",
      "Constantinople was sacked by the Turks. The rude Pelasgic altar, the\r\n",
      "sculptured god of Praxiteles, then down through the ages of decay to\r\n",
      "the ugly painting of the Byzantine monk in the Dark Ages. So too the\r\n",
      "whole history of Rome; the long heave of the wave from Romulus until\r\n",
      "it becomes crested with the might and beauty of the Augustan age;\r\n",
      "the sad subsidence from that summit to Goth and Hun. There was\r\n",
      "architecture which the eyes of the Tarquins saw, there were statues of\r\n",
      "the great consuls of the Republic, the luxury of the later Empire. You\r\n",
      "saw it not only in models, but sometimes in actual relics. One's\r\n",
      "blood thrilled when he stood before a statue of Julius Caesar, whose\r\n",
      "sculptor, it is reasonable to believe, wrought from the life. It was\r\n",
      "broken and discoloured, as it came from the Italian ruin where it had\r\n",
      "lain since the barbarian raids. But the grace had not left the toga\r\n",
      "folded across the breast, nor was the fine Roman majesty gone from the\r\n",
      "head and face,--a head small, but high, with a full and ample brow, a\r\n",
      "nose with the true eagle curve, and thin, firm lips formed to command;\r\n",
      "a statue most subduing in its simple dignity and pathetic in its\r\n",
      "partial ruin. And all this was free to the world as the air of heaven\r\n",
      "almost. No fee for admission; the only requisitions, not to handle,\r\n",
      "orderly behaviour, and decent neatness in attire. Here I saw too, when\r\n",
      "I ascended the steps between the great bronze groups of statuary as I\r\n",
      "entered, and again the last thing as I left, the spiked helmet on the\r\n",
      "head of the stiff sentinel always posted at the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The German home was affectionate and genial. The American, properly\r\n",
      "introduced, was sure of a generous welcome, for it was hard to find\r\n",
      "a German who had not many relatives beyond the Atlantic. There were\r\n",
      "courteous observances which at first put one a little aback. Sneezing,\r\n",
      "for instance, was not a thing that could be done in a corner. If the\r\n",
      "family were a bit old-fashioned, you would be startled and abashed\r\n",
      "by hearing the \"_prosits_\" and \"_Gesundheits_\" from the\r\n",
      "company, wishes that it might be for your advantage and health\r\n",
      "sonorously given, with much friendly nodding in your direction. This\r\n",
      "is a curious survival of an old superstition that sneezing perhaps\r\n",
      "opened a passage through which an evil spirit might enter the body.\r\n",
      "As you rose from the table it was the old-fashioned way, too, to go\r\n",
      "through with a general hand-shaking, and a wish to every one that the\r\n",
      "supper might set well. The Germans are long-lived, and almost every\r\n",
      "domestic hearthstone supports the easy-chairs of grandparents.\r\n",
      "Grandfather was often fresh and cheerful, the oracle and comforter of\r\n",
      "the children, treated with deference by those grown up, and presented\r\n",
      "to the guest as the central figure of the home. As the younger ones\r\n",
      "dropped off to bed and things grew quieter, grandfather's chair was\r\n",
      "apt to be the centre toward which all tended, and, of course, the old\r\n",
      "man talked about his youth. Here are the reminiscences I heard once at\r\n",
      "the end of a merry evening, and at other times I heard something not\r\n",
      "unlike: \"Children and grandchildren and guest from over the sea, when\r\n",
      "I was a boy, Prussia was struggling with the first Napoleon; and\r\n",
      "when I was eighteen I marched myself under Blücher beyond the Rhine.\r\n",
      "Sometimes we went on the run, sometimes we got lifts in relays of\r\n",
      "waggons, and so I have known the infantry even to make now and then\r\n",
      "fifty miles a day. Matters were pressing, you see (_sehen Sie\r\n",
      "'mal_). At last we crossed at Coblentz, and got from there into\r\n",
      "Belgium the first days of June. We met the French at Ligny,--a close,\r\n",
      "bitter fight,--and half my battalion were left behind there where they\r\n",
      "had stood. We were a few paces off, posted in a graveyard, when the\r\n",
      "French cavalry rode over old Marshal Vorwärts, lying under his horse.\r\n",
      "I saw the rush of the French, then the countercharge of the Prussian\r\n",
      "troopers when missed the General and drove the enemy back till they\r\n",
      "found him again; though what it all meant we never knew till it was\r\n",
      "over. Then, after mighty little rest, we marched fast and far, with\r\n",
      "cannon-thunder in our ears in a constant mutter, always growing\r\n",
      "louder, until in the afternoon we came at a quickstep through a piece\r\n",
      "of woods out upon the plain by Waterloo, where they had been fighting\r\n",
      "all day. Our feet sucked in the damp ground, the wet grain brushed our\r\n",
      "knees, as our compact column spread out into more open order and went\r\n",
      "into fire. What a smoke there was about La Haye Sainte and Hougomont,\r\n",
      "with now lines of red infantry, or a column in dark blue, or a mass\r\n",
      "of flashing cuirassiers hidden for a moment, then reappearing! It was\r\n",
      "take and give, hot and heavy, for an hour or so about Planchenoit. A\r\n",
      "ball grazed my elbow and another went through my cap; but at sunset\r\n",
      "the French were broken, and we swept after the rout as well as we\r\n",
      "could through the litter, along the southward roads. We were at a halt\r\n",
      "for a minute, I remember, when a rider in a chapeau with a plume, and\r\n",
      "a hooked nose underneath, trotted up, wrapped in a military cloak,\r\n",
      "and somebody said it was Wellington.\" Grandfather was sure to be at\r\n",
      "a white heat before he had finished, and so, too, his audience. The\r\n",
      "athletic student grandson, with a deep scar across his cheek from a\r\n",
      "_Schläger_ cut, rose and paced the room. The _Fräulien_,\r\n",
      "his sister, to whom the retired grenadier has told the story of the\r\n",
      "feather-beds at Weimar, showed in her eves she remembered it all.\r\n",
      "\"Yes, friend American!\" breaks in the father of the family, \"and it\r\n",
      "all must be done over again. Sooner or later it must come, a great\r\n",
      "struggle with France; the Latin race or the Teutonic, which shall be\r\n",
      "supreme in Europe? We are ready now; arsenals filled, horses waiting,\r\n",
      "equipments for everybody. Son Fritz there has his uniform ready, and\r\n",
      "somewhere there is one for me. _Donnerwetter_! If they get into\r\n",
      "Prussia, they'll find a tough old _Landsturm_! Only let Vater\r\n",
      "Wilhelm turn his hand, and to-morrow close upon a million trained and\r\n",
      "well-armed troops could be stepping to the drum.\" It was an evening at\r\n",
      "the end of June. Napoleon was having the finishing touches put to the\r\n",
      "new Opera House at Paris, thinking, so far as the world could tell,\r\n",
      "of nothing more important than how many imperial eagles it would do to\r\n",
      "put along the cornice. King William was packing for Ems, designing\r\n",
      "to be back at the peaceful unveiling of his father's statue the first\r\n",
      "week in August. Bismarck was at his Pomeranian estate, in poor health,\r\n",
      "it was said, plotting nothing but to circumvent his bodily trouble.\r\n",
      "In less than a month full-armed Prussia was on the march. I could\r\n",
      "understand the readiness, when I thought of the spiked helmet I had\r\n",
      "seen in the Prussian home that quiet summer night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The German _Friedhof_, or burying-ground, had never the extent or\r\n",
      "magnificence of some American cemeteries. Even near the cities it was\r\n",
      "small and quiet, showing, however, in the well-kept mounds and stones\r\n",
      "there was no want of care. Every old church, too, was floored with\r\n",
      "the memorial tablets of those buried beneath, and bare upon walls and\r\n",
      "columns monuments in the taste of the various ages that have come\r\n",
      "and gone since the church was built. Graves of famous men, here as\r\n",
      "everywhere, were places of pilgrimage, and here as everywhere to\r\n",
      "see which are the most honoured tombs, was no bad way of judging the\r\n",
      "character of the people. Among the scholars of Germany there have been\r\n",
      "no greater names than those of Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm, brothers not\r\n",
      "far apart in the cradle, not far apart in death, who lived and worked\r\n",
      "together their full threescore years and ten. They were two wonderful\r\n",
      "old men, with faces--as I saw them together in a photograph shown me\r\n",
      "by Hermann Grimm, the well-known son of Wilhelm--full of intellectual\r\n",
      "strength, and yet with the sweetness and innocence of children. They\r\n",
      "lie now side by side in the Matthäi Kirchhof at Berlin, in graves\r\n",
      "precisely similar, with a lovely rose-bush scattering petals\r\n",
      "impartially on the turf above both, and solid twin stones at their\r\n",
      "heads, meant to endure apparently as long as their fame. Hither come a\r\n",
      "large and various company of pilgrims,--children who love the brothers\r\n",
      "Grimm for their fairy-tales, young students who have been kindled by\r\n",
      "their example, and grey old scholars who respect their achievements\r\n",
      "as the most marvellous work of the marvellous German erudition. The\r\n",
      "little North German city, Weimar, is closely associated with the\r\n",
      "great literary men of the last hundred years. Here several of them\r\n",
      "accomplished their best work under the patronage of an enlightened\r\n",
      "duke, and finally found their graves. An atmosphere of reverend\r\n",
      "quiet seemed to hang over it as I walked through its shaded\r\n",
      "streets,--streets where there is never bustle, and which appear to\r\n",
      "be always remembering the great men who have walked in them. In the\r\n",
      "burying-ground in the outskirts I found the mausoleum of the ruling\r\n",
      "house, a decorated hall of marble with a crypt underneath in which\r\n",
      "are the coffins. The members of the Saxe-Weimar family for many\r\n",
      "generations are here; the warlike ancestor with his armour rusting on\r\n",
      "the dusty lid, grand-duke and duchess, and the child that died before\r\n",
      "it attained the coronet. But far more interesting than any of these\r\n",
      "are two large plain caskets of oak, lying side by side at the foot of\r\n",
      "the staircase by which you descend. In these are the bones of Goethe\r\n",
      "and Schiller. The heap of wreaths, some of them still fresh, which lay\r\n",
      "on the tops, the number on the coffin of Schiller being noticeably the\r\n",
      "larger, showed how green their memory had been kept in the heart of\r\n",
      "the nation. I was only one of a great multitude of pilgrims who are\r\n",
      "coming always, their chief errand being to see the graves of these\r\n",
      "famous dead within the quiet town. In the side of the Schloss Kirche,\r\n",
      "in the city of Wittenberg, is an old archway, with pillars carved as\r\n",
      "if twisted and with figures of saints overhead, the sharpness of the\r\n",
      "cutting being somewhat broken and worn away through time. It is\r\n",
      "the doorway which rang loud three hundred years ago to the sound of\r\n",
      "Luther's hammer as he nailed up his ninety-five theses. Within the\r\n",
      "church, about midway toward the altar and near the wall, the guide\r\n",
      "lifts an oaken trap-door and shows you, beneath, the slab which covers\r\n",
      "Luther's ashes. Just opposite, in a sepulchre precisely similar, lies\r\n",
      "Melancthon, and in the chancel near by, in tombs rather more stately,\r\n",
      "the electors of Saxony that befriended the reformers. A spot worthy\r\n",
      "indeed to be a place of pilgrimage! attracting not only those who\r\n",
      "bless the men, but those who curse them. Charles V. and Alva stood\r\n",
      "once on the pavement where the visitor now stands, and the Emperor\r\n",
      "commanded the stone to be removed from the grave of Luther. Did the\r\n",
      "body turn in its coffin at the violation? It might well have been so,\r\n",
      "for never was there fiercer hate. For three centuries the generations\r\n",
      "have trooped hitherward, more often drawn in reverence, but sometimes\r\n",
      "through very hatred, a multitude too mighty to be numbered. But there\r\n",
      "is a grave in Prussia, where, if I mistake not, the pilgrims are\r\n",
      "more numerous and the interest, for the average Prussian, deeper than\r\n",
      "scholar or poet or reformer call out. The garrison church at Potsdam\r\n",
      "has a plain name and is a plain edifice, when one thinks of the\r\n",
      "sepulchre it holds. Hung upon the walls are dusty trophies; there are\r\n",
      "few embellishments besides. You make your way through the aisles\r\n",
      "among the pews where the regiments sit at service, marching from their\r\n",
      "barracks close by, then through a door beneath the pulpit enter a\r\n",
      "vault lighted by tapers along the wall. Two heavy coffins stand on the\r\n",
      "stone floor,--the older one that of Frederick William I., that despot,\r\n",
      "partially insane, perhaps, who yet accomplished great things for\r\n",
      "Prussia; the other that of his famous son, Frederick the Great, whose\r\n",
      "sword cut the path by which Prussia advanced to her vast power. On the\r\n",
      "copper lid formerly lay that sword, until the great Napoleon when\r\n",
      "he stood there, feeling a twinge of jealousy perhaps over the dead\r\n",
      "leader's fame, carried it away with him. Father and son lie quietly\r\n",
      "enough now side by side, though their relations in life were stormy.\r\n",
      "About the great soldier's sleep every hour rolls the drumbeat from the\r\n",
      "garrison close by. The tramp of the columns as they come in to worship\r\n",
      "jar the warrior's ashes. The dusky standards captured in the Seven\r\n",
      "Years' War droop about him. The hundred intervening years have\r\n",
      "blackened them, already singed in the fire of Zorndorf, Leuthen, and\r\n",
      "Torgau. The moth makes still larger the rent where the volleys passed.\r\n",
      "The spiked helmet is even here among the tombs; and schooled as the\r\n",
      "Prussians are among the din of trumpets and smoke of wars, no other\r\n",
      "among the mighty graves in their land holds dust, in their thought, so\r\n",

      "Seven hundred years ago Frederick's ancestor Conrad, the younger son\r\n",

      "good head and arm, won favour with the Emperor Barbarossa and became\r\n",

      "of Ost and West Preussen; now it was possessions in Silesia, now again\r\n",
      "territory on the Rhine. Power came sometimes through imperial gift,\r\n",
      "sometimes through marriage, sometimes through purchase or diplomacy\r\n",
      "or blows. From poor soldiers of fortune to counts, from counts to\r\n",
      "princes, from princes to electors, and at last kings. Sometimes\r\n",
      "they are unscrupulous, sometimes feeble, sometimes nobly heroic\r\n",
      "and faithful; more often strong than weak in brain and hand.\r\n",
      "The Hohenzollern tortoise keeps creeping forward in its history,\r\n",
      "surpassing many a swift hare that once despised it in the race. I\r\n",
      "believe it is the oldest princely line in Europe. There is certainly\r\n",
      "none whose history on the whole is better. Margraf George of\r\n",
      "Anspach-Baireuth was perhaps the finest character among the Protestant\r\n",

      "Lorraine, had just been torn from Germany by the French), and was\r\n",
      "compelled by the cold to withdraw, it was a Hohenzollern prince, one\r\n",
      "of the first soldiers of the time, who led the rear-guard over ground\r\n",
      "which another Hohenzollern, Prince Frederick Charles, has again made\r\n",
      "famous. Later, in Frederick the Great, the house furnished one of the\r\n",

      "wore the purple, and, after their wild battle with the elements of\r\n",

      "majestic figures for the most part, idealised by the sculptor, and\r\n",
      "yet probably not far beyond nature; for the imperial dignity was not\r\n",
      "hereditary, but given to the man chosen for it, and the choice was\r\n",
      "often a worthy one. They were leaders in character as well as station,\r\n",
      "and it is right to give their images the bearing of men strong in war\r\n",
      "and council. I felt that if the ancient dignity was to be revived in\r\n",
      "our own day, and the sceptre of Barbarossa and Rudolph of Hapsburg to\r\n",

      "A STUDENT'S EXPERIENCE IN THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We rememberers lie under certain suspicion. \"Uncle Mose,\" said an\r\n",
      "inquirer, his intonation betraying scepticism, \"they say you remember\r\n",

      "Not having joined Uncle Mose's church, my memory has not experienced\r\n",
      "the ecclesiastical discouragement that befell him. I humbly trust,\r\n",
      "however, it needs no chastening, and aver that I do not go for my\r\n",
      "facts to my imagination. I am now in foreign parts dealing with\r\n",
      "personages of especial dignity and splendour and must establish my\r\n",
      "memory firmly in the reader's confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was a student in Germany in 1870. In the spring at Berlin, passing\r\n",
      "by the not very conspicuous royal palace on Unter den Linden, one day\r\n",
      "I studied the front with some interest. The two sentinels stood in the\r\n",
      "door saluting with clock-work precision the officers who frequently\r\n",
      "passed. A watchful policeman was on the corner, but there was little\r\n",
      "other sign that an important personage was within the walls. With some\r\n",
      "shock I suddenly caught sight, in a window close at hand, of a tall,\r\n",
      "robust figure with a rugged but not ungenial face surmounted by\r\n",
      "grizzled hair, in uniform with decorations hanging upon the broad\r\n",
      "breast, who, as I glanced up, saluted me with an unlooked-for nod. I\r\n",
      "knew at once it was the King of Prussia, who before the year was ended\r\n",
      "was to be crowned as Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse at Versailles. I was\r\n",
      "thoroughly scared, as I did not know that it was the habit of the King\r\n",
      "to stand in the window and good-naturedly greet the passer-by.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was my first sight of a real king. But there is another figure\r\n",
      "which I contemplate with more interest. The 31st of May of 1870 was a\r\n",
      "day sent from heaven, brilliant sunshine after a period of cloud; the\r\n",
      "spring lording it in the air, the trees and grass in their freshest\r\n",
      "luxuriance. I was at Potsdam that day; in the wide-stretching gardens\r\n",
      "that surround the New Palace. As I walked, I came to a cord drawn\r\n",
      "across the path, indicating that visitors were to go no farther. Close\r\n",
      "by stood a tall young grenadier on duty as a sentinel, but willing to\r\n",
      "chat. Looking beyond the cord into the reserved space I presently saw\r\n",
      "coming up from a secluded path, a low carriage drawn by a pony led by\r\n",
      "a groom in which was seated a lady dressed in white. She was not of\r\n",
      "distinguished appearance but my grenadier told me that it was the\r\n",
      "Crown Princess of Prussia, the daughter of the Queen of England.\r\n",
      "From the screen of the bush I watched her with natural interest. The\r\n",
      "carriage paused and a group of little boys and girls came running\r\n",
      "out from the thicket attended by a governess or two and a tutor. The\r\n",
      "little girls had their hands full of flowers, which, running forward,\r\n",
      "they threw into the carriage. The boys, too, ran up with pretty\r\n",
      "demonstrations, and a straight little fellow of ten years or so\r\n",
      "hurried to the groom and began to pat the pony's nose. These, I\r\n",
      "learned, were the princes and princesses of the royal family. The\r\n",
      "little fellow patting the pony's nose was the eldest and destined to\r\n",
      "emerge into history as Kaiser Wilhelm the Second.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, from a door of the palace, not far distant, came striding\r\n",
      "a notable figure, tall and stalwart, in the undress uniform of a\r\n",
      "Prussian General. Under his fatigue cap the blond hair was abundant; a\r\n",
      "wave of brown beard swept flown upon his breast. The face was full of\r\n",
      "intelligence and authority, but at that moment most kindly as his blue\r\n",
      "eyes sought the group that stood in the foreground. It was the Crown\r\n",
      "Prince of Prussia, destined at length to be the Emperor Friedrich.\r\n",
      "The carriage passed on, the Crown Prince walking, with his hand on the\r\n",
      "side, while the Princess held her parasol over his head, laughing at\r\n",
      "the idea evidently, that so sturdy a soldier needed that kind of a\r\n",
      "screen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Crown Prince Friedrich was unpopular in those days as too\r\n",
      "domestic, standing too much withdrawn from the bustling world, but\r\n",
      "there was no failure when the stress came. Only a few weeks passed\r\n",
      "before the stout soldier, whom I had seen throwing lilies and\r\n",
      "sheltered from the sun by his wife's parasol, was at the head of\r\n",
      "a great army corps, crushing the power of France at Worth and\r\n",
      "Weissembourg; but the report was that he had said, \"I do not like war,\r\n",
      "and if I am ever King I shall never make war.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few weeks after the Potsdam incident I was in the city of Vienna.\r\n",
      "One morning, like thunder out of a clear sky, news came of the\r\n",
      "outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war. I read the paper, but, not\r\n",
      "feeling that the news need interfere with my sight-seeing, went to the\r\n",
      "Hofbourg, the old palace, in the heart of the city, of the Imperial\r\n",
      "family of Austria. The building is extensive; the streets of the city\r\n",
      "at that time running under it here and there in tunnels. I visited\r\n",
      "the _Schatz_ Kammer, the treasure-room, and saw men go almost\r\n",
      "demented at the spectacle of the gold and jewels heaped up in the\r\n",
      "cases. The sight of the splendour, the heaped-up jewels, the\r\n",
      "batons, the faded, and sometimes bloody, garments, the trinkets and\r\n",
      "decorations, associated with towering personalities of the past,\r\n",
      "attuned my spirit for some adventure above the commonplace. As I came\r\n",
      "down into the street, narrow and overhung by the confining arch, a\r\n",
      "soldier passed me on the run into an open space just beyond, where\r\n",
      "instantly a battalion hurried out to stand at present. Then in the\r\n",
      "distance I heard galloping of horses and an open carriage rapidly\r\n",
      "approached, in which were seated four figures, protected from the\r\n",
      "light rain by grey overcoats, wearing the chapeaux which have come\r\n",
      "down from Napoleonic times. The carriage passed so near that I was\r\n",
      "obliged to press back against the wall to save my feet from the\r\n",
      "wheels, and a figure on the back seat, who, for the moment, was within\r\n",
      "arm's reach, I recognised as Francis Joseph.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was then a man in his best years, a strong, sensible if not\r\n",
      "impressive face, and a well-knit frame. He had driven in from\r\n",
      "Schönbrunn to attend a council meeting, and the day for him was no\r\n",
      "doubt a most critical one. War had come. It was only four years after\r\n",
      "Königgrätz. His old enemy, Prussia, was about to hurl herself, with\r\n",
      "who could tell what allies, against France. What stand should Austria\r\n",
      "take? If the Kaiser was agitated, his face did not show it; it was\r\n",
      "significant of quiet, cool poise. Excitement was repressed, while good\r\n",
      "sense weighed and determined. Few sovereigns have been obliged to face\r\n",
      "so often situations of the utmost difficulty. I can believe that with\r\n",
      "similar imperturbability Francis Joseph has confronted the series of\r\n",
      "perplexities which make up the tangled story of his long career, and\r\n",
      "I count it good fortune that I witnessed, in a moment of supreme\r\n",
      "embarrassment, the balance and resolution with which the good ruler\r\n",
      "went to his task. Austria, as the world knows, decided that day to be\r\n",
      "neutral in the Franco-Prussian quarrel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The disorder in the land made me feel that I must get nearer to my\r\n",
      "base, so I hurriedly left Vienna for Munich, which I found seething\r\n",
      "with agitation, for, like Austria, Bavaria had only a few years before\r\n",
      "been Prussia's enemy, and so far as the populace was concerned all\r\n",
      "was in doubt as to what course would now be taken. The rumour was that\r\n",
      "McMahon had crossed the Rhine at Strassburg with 150,000 men, and was\r\n",
      "marching to interpose between Northern and Southern Germany.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the Ober-Pollinger I heard in the inn, amid the stormy discussion\r\n",
      "of the crisis, something quite out of harmony with the spirit of the\r\n",
      "hour. The first performance was to be given in the Royal Opera House\r\n",
      "of a work of Richard Wagner, the _Rheingold_. Wagner in those\r\n",
      "days had not attained his great fame, and, to a man like me, who had\r\n",
      "no especial interest in music, was a name almost unknown, but I went\r\n",
      "with the crowd, thinking to help out a dreary evening rather than to\r\n",
      "enjoy a masterpiece. The house was crowded. In the centre before the\r\n",
      "stage an ample space was occupied by the royal box, richly carved and\r\n",
      "draped. Presently the King entered, a slender, graceful figure in a\r\n",
      "dress suit, his dark rather melancholy face looking handsome in the\r\n",
      "gorgeous setting of the theatre. The crowded audience rose to their\r\n",
      "feet in a tumult of enthusiasm. The air resounded with \"Hoch! Hoch!\"\r\n",
      "the German cheer, and handkerchiefs waved like a snow-storm. The\r\n",
      "King bowed right and left in acknowledgment of the plaudits, and\r\n",
      "the performance of the evening was kept long in waiting. The line of\r\n",
      "Bavarian kings has perhaps little title to our respect. The Ludwig\r\n",
      "of fifty years ago was a voluptuary, vacillating, like another Louis\r\n",
      "Quinze, between debauchery and a weak pietism. He probably merited the\r\n",
      "cuts of the relentless scourge of Heine than which no instrument of\r\n",
      "chastisement was ever more unsparing, and which in his case was put\r\n",
      "to its most merciless use; but he loved art and lavished his revenues\r\n",
      "upon pictures, statues, and churches, which the world admires,\r\n",
      "imparting a benefit, though his subjects groaned. His successor,\r\n",
      "whom I saw, was a man morbid and without force, who early came to a\r\n",
      "sorrowful end. His redeeming quality was a fine aesthetic taste,\r\n",
      "which he had no doubt through heredity, together with a sad burden of\r\n",
      "disease. The world remembers kindly that he was a prodigal patron of\r\n",
      "art.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went to Heidelberg in February, 1870, bent upon a quiet year of\r\n",
      "study in Germany and France. Fate had a different programme for me. My\r\n",
      "plans were badly interfered with but to see Europe in such a turmoil\r\n",
      "was an experience well worth having. Heidelberg that spring was very\r\n",
      "peaceful. The ice in the Neckar on which skaters were disporting on\r\n",
      "my arrival passed out in due course of time to the Rhine, the foliage\r\n",
      "broke forth in glory on the noble hills and the nightingales came back\r\n",
      "to sing in the ivy about the storied ruins. There was no suggestion in\r\n",
      "the air of cannon thunder. At Berlin, however, as I have described, I\r\n",
      "found things wearing a warlike air. I was eager to perfect my German\r\n",
      "and sought chances to talk with all whom I met, and often had pleasant\r\n",
      "converse with the young soldiers who when off duty numerously flocked\r\n",
      "to the gardens and street corners. I recall in particular three young\r\n",
      "soldiers whose subsequent fate I should like to know. The first was\r\n",
      "a handsome young grenadier who had talked with me affably as we stood\r\n",
      "together screened by the bush in the garden of the New Palace at\r\n",
      "Potsdam watching the family of the Crown Prince, that beautiful\r\n",
      "forenoon in May.... When I told him I had myself _mitgemacht_ the\r\n",
      "Civil War in America he at once accorded me respect as a veteran.\r\n",
      "I think he was a _Freiwilliger_, one of the class, who, having\r\n",
      "reached a high status in the Gymnasium, enjoyed the privilege of a\r\n",
      "shorter term of service. He had the bearing of a cultivated gentleman\r\n",
      "and there was strength in his firm young face which I have no doubt\r\n",
      "made him a good soldier in the time of stress. We shook hands at last\r\n",
      "in the friendliest way and I saw him no more. A few days later the\r\n",
      "train in which I was riding stopped at Erfurt and among the groups\r\n",
      "at the station was one that interested me much. In the centre stood\r\n",
      "a sturdy young Uhlan gaudy in full dress which I fancied he had only\r\n",
      "lately assumed, his stature was increased by his lofty horse-hair\r\n",
      "plume and he wore his corselet over a uniform in which there was many\r\n",
      "a dye. A bevy of pretty girls thronged around him, freshly beautiful\r\n",
      "after the German type, blond and blue-eyed in attractive summer\r\n",
      "draperies, and I speculated pleasantly as to which among them were\r\n",
      "sisters and which sweethearts. As the train departed the young Uhlan\r\n",
      "climbed into my compartment and we sat vis-à-vis as we rode on through\r\n",
      "the country. He was a frank ingenuous boy of twenty with eyes that\r\n",
      "danced with life, and a mobile play of features. My claim that I had\r\n",
      "seen service in the tented field again served me in good stead as an\r\n",
      "introduction; it was a passport to his confidence and I had a pleasant\r\n",
      "hour or two with him until he left me at length at his rendezvous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Best of all I remember a third encounter. When I stepped from my car\r\n",
      "at Weimar I asked a direction from a young grenadier off duty who\r\n",
      "stood at hand on the platform. He too possessed the usual Teutonic\r\n",
      "vigour and strength. A conversation sprang up in which I explained\r\n",
      "that I was an American and desired to see as well as I could in a\r\n",
      "few hours the interesting things in that little city so quiet and\r\n",
      "renowned. I had found out by this time that my small veteranship was\r\n",
      "a good asset and paraded it for all it was worth and as usual it told.\r\n",
      "He was off duty for a few hours and had never visited the shrines of\r\n",
      "Weimar, and if I had no objection he would like to go with me on\r\n",
      "my tour of inspection, so together we walked through those shadowed\r\n",
      "streets, which seemed to be haunted even in that bright sunshine by\r\n",
      "the ghosts of the great men who have walked in them. We saw the homes\r\n",
      "of Goethe and Schiller, the noble statues of the _Dichter-Paar_,\r\n",
      "and the old theatre behind it in which were first performed the\r\n",
      "masterpieces of the German drama. We went together to the cemetery\r\n",
      "and descending into the crypt of the mausoleum stood by the coffins\r\n",
      "of Goethe and Schiller, the men most illustrious in German letters.\r\n",
      "It was a memorable day of my life, the outward conditions perfect, the\r\n",
      "June sunshine, the wealth of lovely foliage, the bird songs, and right\r\n",
      "at hand the homes and haunts of the inspired singers whom I especially\r\n",
      "reverenced. I was most fortunate in my companionship, the bearing of\r\n",
      "the youth was marked by no flippancy, he venerated as I did the lofty\r\n",
      "spirits into whose retreats we had penetrated. He was familiar with\r\n",
      "their masterpieces and we felt for them a like appreciation. His\r\n",
      "soldierly garb accorded perhaps ill with the peaceful suggestions of\r\n",
      "the hour and place, but in his mind plainly the sentiment lay deep, a\r\n",

      "myself may have figured as one of his examples. My feeling is that\r\n",

      "certainly have shown some kindness. My few pieces of silver jingled\r\n",

      "some roundabout way from Paris and they were prepared to pay me the\r\n",

      "danger. Instead of the throngs at the great points of interest, the\r\n",
      "visitors counted by twos and threes. The guides and landlords were\r\n",
      "obsequious. We few strangers had the Alps to ourselves and they were\r\n",
      "as lavish of their splendours to the handful as to the multitude. At\r\n",
      "Geneva at last I found letters from home which caused me anxiety; I\r\n",
      "was referred for later news to letters which were to be sent to Paris;\r\n",
      "so there was nothing for it but for me to cross France, though by that\r\n",

      "an American friend who was proficient in French as I was not and\r\n",
      "who likewise found it necessary to go to Paris, and we two started\r\n",

      "another old storied city famous in former wars, and now again\r\n",
      "humming with the military life with which they had been so many times\r\n",
      "familiar. The _Mobiles_ came thronging to every depot from\r\n",
      "the vineyards and fields and the remoter villages. As yet they were\r\n",
      "usually in picturesque peasant attire, young farmers in blouses or\r\n",
      "with _bretelles_ crossing in odd fashion the queer shirts they\r\n",
      "wore. Careless happy-go-lucky boys chattering in the excitement of\r\n",
      "the new life which they were entering, only half-informed as to the\r\n",
      "catastrophes which were taking place, but the mothers and sisters,\r\n",
      "plain country women in short skirts, quaint bodices and caps, looked\r\n",
      "upon their departure with anxious faces. I was familiar enough with\r\n",

      "Rage and mortification over the fast-accumulating German successes\r\n",

      "First Empire, strong and resolute, with an evident capacity for taking\r\n",
      "care of themselves even in the small matter of cooking their soup, and\r\n",
      "providing for their needs there on the asphalt. Their officers were\r\n",
      "soldierly figures on horseback, dressed for rough work, and the\r\n",
      "gaitered legs, with the stout shoes below dusty already from long\r\n",
      "marching, were plainly capable of much more. There was a pathos about\r\n",
      "it all, however, a marked absence of _élan_ and enthusiasm, the\r\n",
      "faces under the _képis_ were firm and strong enough but they had\r\n",
      "little hope. Nothing so paralyses a soldier as want of confidence in\r\n",
      "the leadership and these poor fellows had lost that. The regiments\r\n",
      "passed on in turn, the sunlight glittering on their arms. Through the\r\n",
      "vista of the boulevard the eagles of the Second Empire rose above,\r\n",
      "the grave colonels were conspicuous at the head, and the drum-beats,\r\n",
      "choked by the towering buildings, sounded a melancholy muffled march\r\n",
      "that was befitting. It was the scene pictured by Détaille in _Le\r\n",
      "Régiment quì Passe_. Could he have been with us on the curbstone\r\n",
      "making his studies? It was indeed for them a funeral march, for they\r\n",

      "The theatres were closed. No one was admitted to the Invalides, so\r\n",
      "that I could not see the tomb of Napoleon. The Madeleine was open for\r\n",
      "service, but deep silence prevailed. In the great spaces of the temple\r\n",
      "the robed priests bowed before the altar and noiseless groups of\r\n",
      "worshippers knelt on the pavement. It was a time for earnest prayers.\r\n",
      "The Louvre was still open and I was fortunate enough to see the Venus\r\n",
      "of Milo, though a day or two after I believe it was taken from its\r\n",
      "pedestal and carefully concealed. The expectation was of something\r\n",
      "dreadful and still the city did not take in the sorrow which lay\r\n",
      "before it. \"Do you think the Prussians will bombard Paris?\" I heard\r\n",
      "a man exclaim, his voice and manner indicating that such a thing was\r\n",
      "incredible, but the Prussian cannon were close at hand. For our part,\r\n",
      "my companion and I thought we were in no especial danger. We quartered\r\n",
      "ourselves comfortably at a pension, walked freely about the streets,\r\n",
      "and saw what could be seen with the usual zest of healthy young\r\n",
      "travellers. The little steamboats were still plying on the Seine and\r\n",
      "we took one at last for the trip that opens to one so much that is\r\n",
      "beautiful and interesting in architecture and history. It was a lovely\r\n",

      "deck we became aware that we were undergoing careful scrutiny\r\n",
      "from a considerable group who for the most part made up our\r\n",
      "fellow-passengers. We had had no thought of ourselves as especially\r\n",
      "marked. My clothes, however, had been made in Germany and had\r\n",
      "peculiarities no doubt which indicated as much. I was fairly well\r\n",
      "grounded in French but had no practice in speaking. In trying to talk\r\n",
      "French, my tongue in spite of me ran into German, which I had been\r\n",
      "speaking constantly for six months. This was particularly the case if\r\n",
      "I was at all embarrassed; my face and figure, moreover, were plainly\r\n",
      "Teutonic and not Latin. The French ascribed their disasters largely to\r\n",
      "the fact that German spies were everywhere prying into the conditions,\r\n",
      "and reporting every assailable point and element of weakness. This\r\n",
      "belief was well grounded; the Germans probably knew France better than\r\n",
      "the French themselves and skilfully adapted their attacks to the lacks\r\n",
      "and negligences which the swarming spies laid bare. The group, of\r\n",
      "whose scrutiny we had become aware, was made up of _ouvriers_ and\r\n",
      "_ouvrières_, the men in the invariable blouse, with dark matted\r\n",
      "hair and black eyes, sometimes with a ratlike keenness of glance as\r\n",
      "they surveyed us. The women were roughly dressed, sometimes in sabots,\r\n",
      "with heads bare or surmounted by conical caps. They belonged to the\r\n",
      "proletariat, the class out of which had come in the Reign of Terror\r\n",
      "the sans-culottes of evil memory and the _tricoteuses_ who had\r\n",
      "sat knitting about the _guillotine_, the class which, within\r\n",
      "a few months, was again to set the world aghast as the mob of _La\r\n",
      "Commune_. As we stood disconcerted by their intent gaze, they put\r\n",
      "their heads together and talked in low and rapid tones; then their\r\n",
      "spokesman approached us, a man of polite bearing but ominously stern.\r\n",
      "He was not a clumsy fellow, but darkly forceful and direct, a man\r\n",
      "capable of a quick, desperate deed. At the moment there was the grim\r\n",
      "tiger in their eyes and from the soft paw the swift protrusion of the\r\n",
      "cruel claw. One thought of the wild revolutionary song, \"Ça ça, ça\r\n",
      "ira, les aristocrats à la lanterne!\" They were the children of the mob\r\n",
      "that had sung that song. With a bow, the spokesman said: \"Messieurs,\r\n",
      "we think you are Germans and we wish to know if we are right.\" We\r\n",
      "protested that we were Americans, but the spokesman said he was\r\n",
      "unconvinced, and as he pressed for further evidence I gave way to my\r\n",
      "companion whose readier French could deal better with the situation.\r\n",
      "He demanded to see our passports with which fortunately we were both\r\n",
      "provided; I had not thought of a passport as a necessity, and almost\r\n",
      "by chance had procured one the week before from our Minister\r\n",
      "in Switzerland, a careful description, vouching for my American\r\n",
      "citizenship, signed and sealed by the United States official.\r\n",
      "This perhaps saved my life. We surrendered our passports to our\r\n",
      "interrogator; he carried them back to the throng behind him who were\r\n",
      "now glowering angrily at us, as they chattered among themselves.\r\n",
      "Half-amused and half-alarmed, we waited while the documents were\r\n",
      "passed from hand to hand, carefully conned and inspected. We could not\r\n",
      "believe that we were in danger, here in the bright day in beautiful\r\n",
      "Paris, with the sacred towers of Notre Dame soaring close at hand.\r\n",
      "There were no _gendarmes_ on the boat or on the quays, but how\r\n",
      "could it he that we needed protection? After a quarter of an hour's\r\n",
      "suspense, during which there had been a voluble counselling among\r\n",

      "carefully folded, these he returned to us, touching his hat with a\r\n",
      "stiff and formal bow. \"We have persuaded ourselves,\" said he, \"that\r\n",
      "you are what you claim to be, Americans, and it is fortunate for you\r\n",
      "that it is so, for we had intended to throw you into the Seine as\r\n",
      "Prussian spies.\" Here was a surprise indeed! The group then dispersed\r\n",
      "about the boat apparently satisfied. Still rather amused than alarmed\r\n",
      "we pocketed our passports. Under the arch of one of the stately\r\n",
      "bridges close by, the Seine flowed in heavy shadows on its way, and\r\n",
      "we looked down upon the dark waters. Throbbing with life as we were,\r\n",
      "could it be possible that we had just escaped a grave in its watery\r\n",
      "embrace? Presently we landed light-hearted, and were again in the\r\n",
      "streets, but in days that followed immediately my heart was often in\r\n",
      "my throat, as I read in the papers of the corpses of men taken out of\r\n",
      "the river who undoubtedly had been thrown in under suspicion of being\r\n",
      "German spies. After a sojourn of not quite a week in Paris we made up\r\n",

      "be done in France. I had letters which in a time of peace would have\r\n",
      "opened the way for me to many a pleasant circle. My intention had been\r\n",
      "to study for some time in France, but under the circumstances it would\r\n",
      "be a comfortable thing to have the Atlantic rolling between me\r\n",
      "and Europe, and therefore, I prepared to depart for home. At the\r\n",
      "_pension_, on the day I had fixed for departure, while coming\r\n",

      "for the North, on almost the last train that left the city, at the end\r\n",
      "of August. The sights were gloomy, the towns which we passed seemed\r\n",
      "associated with ancient bloodshed. We touched St. Quentin and crossed\r\n",
      "the field of Malplaquet, and finally near Mons passed the Belgian\r\n",
      "frontier. Marlborough and the names associated with former wars were\r\n",

      "Grecian face relieved against a dignified background as he sat on the\r\n",
      "stage among the Corporation of Harvard University. Motley I have\r\n",
      "only seen as he stood with iron-grey curls over a ruddy, strenuous\r\n",
      "countenance topping a figure of vigorous symmetry as he spoke with\r\n",
      "animation at a scholars' dinner. But George Bancroft, Justin Winsor,\r\n",
      "and John Fiske I knew well, the last being in particular one of my\r\n",
      "best friends. I could tell stories too, of the living lights, but am\r\n",
      "concerned here with the ghosts and not with men still red-blooded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I first saw George Bancroft when he was Minister at Berlin. He had\r\n",
      "read a little book of mine, The Color Guard, my diary as a Corporal of\r\n",
      "the Nineteenth Army Corps, scribbled off on my cap-top, my gun-stock,\r\n",
      "or indeed my shoe-sole, or whatever desk I could extemporise as we\r\n",
      "marched and fought. That book gave me some claim to his notice, but a\r\n",
      "better claim was that his wife was Elizabeth Davis, whom more than\r\n",
      "a hundred years ago my grandfather of the ancient First Parish in\r\n",
      "Plymouth had baptised and who as a girl had been my mother's playmate\r\n",
      "in gardens near Plymouth Rock. I did not presume upon such credentials\r\n",
      "as these to obtrude myself, and was pleasantly surprised one day by\r\n",
      "a note inviting me to the Embassy. It was a retired house near the\r\n",
      "Thiergarten. I found Mr. Bancroft embarrassed with duties which in\r\n",
      "those days gave trouble. German emigrants returning after prosperous\r\n",
      "years to the Fatherland were often pounced upon, the validity of their\r\n",
      "American citizenship denied, and taxes and military service demanded.\r\n",
      "It was tough work to straighten out such knots and the Minister was\r\n",
      "in the midst of such a tangle. But his high, broad forehead smoothed\r\n",
      "presently, and his grey eyes grew genial, while the vivacious features\r\n",
      "spoke with the very cordial impulse with which he greeted one who\r\n",
      "had heard the bullets of the Civil War whistle and was the son of his\r\n",
      "wife's old friend. Another tie was that his father, Dr. Aaron Bancroft\r\n",
      "of Worcester, and my grandfather, had stood shoulder to shoulder\r\n",
      "in the controversy of a century ago which rent apart New England\r\n",
      "Congregationalism. Presently we sat down to lunch, a party of three,\r\n",
      "for the board was graced by the presence of Mrs. Bancroft, a woman\r\n",
      "of fine accomplishments polished through contact with high society in\r\n",
      "many lands, and a gifted talker. Many readers have found her published\r\n",
      "letters charming. The talk was largely of the Civil War and Bancroft's\r\n",
      "words were in the best sense patriotic. During and before that period\r\n",
      "his course had been much disapproved. He had been Collector of Boston\r\n",
      "under Democratic auspices and had served under Polk as Secretary\r\n",
      "of the Navy, where he laid the country lastingly under debt by\r\n",
      "establishing the Naval Academy at Annapolis. I do not approve or\r\n",
      "condemn, but I felt him wisely and warmly patriotic, deeply concerned\r\n",
      "that the outcome of our long national agony should be worthy of the\r\n",
      "sacrifice. The breath of a pleasant spring day pervaded the elegant\r\n",
      "apartment while the birds sang in the tall trees stretching out\r\n",
      "toward the forest of the Thiergarten. I especially associate with the\r\n",
      "Bancrofts their beautiful outdoor environment. Another day I drove\r\n",
      "with the Minister, our companions in the carriage being the wife and\r\n",
      "the daughter of Ernst Curtius, to visit the rose gardens about Berlin.\r\n",
      "I have met few men readier or more agreeable in conversation. With a\r\n",
      "pleasant smile and intonation he touched gracefully on this and that,\r\n",
      "sometimes in reminiscence. I remember in particular a vivid setting\r\n",
      "forth of an interview with Goethe which he had enjoyed as a boy fifty\r\n",
      "years before. Sometimes his talk was of poetry in general and I was\r\n",
      "much struck with his frequent happy application of quotations to the\r\n",
      "little events of the drive and phases of feeling that came up as the\r\n",
      "day went on. The sun set gloriously, \"_So stirbt ein Held_,\" said\r\n",
      "Bancroft, as he burst with feeling into the beautiful lyric of which\r\n",
      "these words are a line. The best German poetry seemed to be at his\r\n",
      "tongue's end and he recited it with sympathy and accuracy which called\r\n",
      "out much admiration from the cultivated German ladies with whom we\r\n",
      "were driving. Most interesting of all was Bancroft's evident passion\r\n",
      "for roses. The gardeners, as we stopped, were plainly surprised at his\r\n",
      "knowledge of their varieties and the best methods of cultivation.\r\n",
      "He was so well versed in the lore of the rose and so devoted to its\r\n",
      "cultivation one might well have thought it his horse and not his\r\n",
      "hobby. He possessed at Newport a rose garden far famed for the number\r\n",
      "of its varieties and the perfection of the flowers, and it was an\r\n",
      "interesting sight at Washington to see Bancroft, even when nearing\r\n",
      "ninety, busy in his garden in H Street, one attendant shielding his\r\n",
      "light figure with a sun umbrella, while another held at hand, hoe,\r\n",
      "shears, and twine, the implements to train and cull. Is there a subtle\r\n",
      "connection between roses and history? Parkman wrote an elaborate book\r\n",
      "upon rose culture which I believe is still of authority, and John\r\n",
      "Fiske had a conservatory opening out of his library and the rose of\r\n",
      "all flowers was the one he prized. Here is a neat turn of McMaster.\r\n",
      "At a dinner given in his honour a big bunch of American Beauties was\r\n",
      "opposite to him as he sat. It fell to me to make a welcoming speech.\r\n",
      "Catching at the occasion, I suggested a connection between roses and\r\n",
      "history and referred to McMaster close behind his American Beauties as\r\n",
      "an instance in point, at the same time expressing with earnestness my\r\n",
      "strong admiration of that good writer's work. McMaster rose, his face\r\n",
      "glowing in response to my emphatic compliment. His speech consisted of\r\n",
      "only one sentence, \"I have one bond with the rose, I blush.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I owe many favours to Bancroft; the greatest perhaps that he allowed\r\n",
      "me to consult to my heart's content the papers of Samuel Adams, a\r\n",
      "priceless collection which he possessed. For this he gave me _carte\r\n",
      "blanche_ to use his library in Washington, though he himself\r\n",
      "was absent, a favour which he said he had never accorded to an\r\n",
      "investigator before. It was an inspiring place for a student, the\r\n",
      "shelves burdened with treasures in manuscript as well as print. The\r\n",
      "most interesting portrait of Bancroft presents him as a nonagenarian,\r\n",
      "against this impressive background, at work to the last. The critics\r\n",
      "of our day minimise Bancroft and his school. History in that time\r\n",
      "walked in garments quite too flowing, it is said, and with an\r\n",
      "overdisplay of the Horatian purple patch. Our grandsons may feel that\r\n",
      "the history of our time walks in garments too sad-coloured and scant.\r\n",
      "Research and accuracy are, of course, primary requisites in this\r\n",
      "field, but there should be some employment of the picturesque. The\r\n",
      "world was beautiful in the old days and human life was vivid. Ought\r\n",
      "we to deny to all this a warm and graphic setting forth? If we do we\r\n",
      "shall do it to our cost. Is it the proper attitude of the historian\r\n",
      "simply to write, without thought of anything so irrelevant as a\r\n",
      "reader? Bancroft was a pioneer, breaking the way ponderously perhaps,\r\n",
      "but he delved faithfully. If the orotund rolls too sonorously in his\r\n",
      "periods it was an excess in which his age upheld him. He was a good\r\n",
      "path-breaker and ought not to be lightly esteemed by those who now go\r\n",
      "to and fro with ease through the roads he opened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My first touch with Justin Winsor was in my Freshman year at\r\n",
      "Cambridge. We both had rooms under the roof of an uncle of mine. His\r\n",
      "room was afterwards occupied, I believe, by Theodore Roosevelt. It had\r\n",
      "been rubbed into me by many snubs that a vast gulf interposed between\r\n",
      "the Freshman and upper-class man. I used to pass his door with\r\n",
      "reverence, for the story went that, even as a boy, he had written a\r\n",
      "history of Duxbury, Massachusetts. Once during his temporary absence,\r\n",
      "his door standing open, I dared to step into the apartment and\r\n",
      "surveyed with awe the well-filled shelves and scribbled papers; but in\r\n",
      "later years when I had won some small title to notice I found him most\r\n",
      "kind and approachable. The abundance of the Harvard Library and still\r\n",
      "better the rich accumulations in the cells of his own memory he held\r\n",
      "for general use. He loaned me once for months at St. Louis a rarely\r\n",
      "precious seventeenth-century book, which had belonged to Carlyle, and\r\n",
      "whose margins were sometimes filled with Carlyle's notes. He imparted\r\n",
      "freely from his own vast information and it was pleasant indeed to\r\n",
      "hold a chair for an hour or two in his hospitable home. In our last\r\n",
      "interview the prose and the solemn romance of life were strangely\r\n",
      "blended. We had just heard the burial service in Appleton Chapel read\r\n",
      "by Phillips Brooks over the coffin of James Russell Lowell; then we\r\n",
      "rode together on the crowded platform of a street-car to the grave at\r\n",
      "Mount Auburn; a rough and jostling company on the platform, and in my\r\n",
      "mind a throng of deep and melancholy thoughts. I never saw him again.\r\n",
      "In his calling he was a master of research extracting with unlimited\r\n",
      "toil the last fragment of evidence from the blindest scribblings of\r\n",
      "earlier times. These results, painfully accumulated, he set down\r\n",
      "with absolute faithfulness; his bibliographies supplementing his own\r\n",
      "contributions and also those of the many writers whom he inspired and\r\n",
      "guided in like labours are exhaustive. Rarely is there a wisp to be\r\n",
      "gleaned where Winsor has garnered. If he was deficient in the power of\r\n",
      "vivid and picturesque presentment, it is only that like all men he had\r\n",
      "his limitations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "John Fiske I met soon after his graduation at Cambridge. It is odd\r\n",
      "to recall him when one thinks of his later physique, as a youth with\r\n",
      "fresh ruddy face, tall and not broad, a rather slender pillar of a\r\n",
      "man, corniced with an abundant pompadour of brown hair. He was just\r\n",
      "then making fame for himself in the domain of philosophy, contributing\r\n",
      "to the New York World papers well charged with revolutionary ideas\r\n",
      "which were then causing consternation, so lucidly and attractively\r\n",
      "formulated that they interested the most cursory reader. Perhaps John\r\n",
      "Fiske ought always to have kept to philosophy. Mrs. Mary Hemenway,\r\n",
      "that princess among Ladies Bountiful, told me once the story of his\r\n",
      "change. He made to her a frank statement of his situation. He was\r\n",
      "conscious of power to do service; he was married, had children, and\r\n",
      "was embarrassed with care about their bread, butter, and education\r\n",
      "after the usual fashion of the scholar. John Fiske said in those days\r\n",
      "the difficult problem of his life was to get enough corn-beef for\r\n",
      "dinner to have hash for breakfast the next day. Must he descend to\r\n",
      "desk and courtroom work to make a way, or could a way be found\r\n",
      "by which he might do his proper task and at the same time be a\r\n",
      "bread-winner? \"Write American history,\" said Mrs. Hemenway, \"and\r\n",
      "I will stand behind you.\" She was inspired with the idea of making\r\n",
      "America in the high sense American and saw in the young genius a good\r\n",
      "ally. The chance was embraced and John Fiske after that dipped only\r\n",
      "fitfully into philosophical themes, writing, however, _The Destiny\r\n",
      "of Man, The Idea of God, Cosmic Roots of Loveland Self-sacrifice_,\r\n",
      "and _Life Everlasting_. He gave his main strength, to a thing\r\n",
      "worth while, the establishment in America of Anglo-Saxon freedom.\r\n",
      "Would he have served the world better had he adhered to profound\r\n",
      "speculations? As the patriarch in a household into which have been\r\n",
      "born a dozen children and grandchildren, I have had good opportunity\r\n",
      "for study. What so feeble as the feebleness of the babe! It depends\r\n",
      "upon its mother for its sustenance, almost for its breath and its\r\n",
      "heart-beats. The sheltering arms and the loving breast must always\r\n",
      "be at hand as the very conditions of its existence. I have watched\r\n",
      "in wife and daughters, as what grandsire has not, the persistent\r\n",
      "sleepless care which alone kept the baby alive, and noted the sweet\r\n",
      "effusion of affection which the need and constant care made to flow\r\n",
      "abundantly, nor do the care and consequent outflow of love cease\r\n",
      "with babyhood. The child must ever be fed, clothed, trained, and\r\n",
      "counselled; and the youth, too, of which the baby is father, must\r\n",
      "be watchfully guided till the stature is completed. The rod of\r\n",
      "Moses smiting the rock evoked the beneficent water, the unremitting\r\n",
      "parent-care striking the indifferent heart evokes the beautiful mother\r\n",
      "and father love which grows abroad. We cannot love children well\r\n",
      "without loving others, their companions, and at last the great worldly\r\n",
      "environment in which they and we all are placed. Hence, from the\r\n",
      "extension of infancy, through a period of long years, proceeds at last\r\n",
      "from the hearts which are subjected to its influence the noble thing\r\n",
      "which we call altruism: love for others than ourselves and the other\r\n",
      "high spiritual instincts which are the crown of human nature. The\r\n",
      "recognition of the extension of infancy as the source from which in\r\n",
      "our slow evolution comes the brightest thing in the universe\r\n",
      "belongs to our own time. It is perhaps the climax of our philosophic\r\n",
      "speculation. What more feeble than the snowflakes! But accumulated and\r\n",
      "compressed they become the glacier which may carapace an entire zone\r\n",
      "and determine its configuration into mountain and valley. What more\r\n",
      "feeble than the feebleness of the babe! And yet that multiplied by the\r\n",
      "million through aeons of time and over continents of space fashions\r\n",
      "humanity after the sublime pattern shown on the Mount. If to John\r\n",
      "Fiske belongs the credit of first recognising in the scheme of\r\n",
      "evolution the significance of this mighty factor, the extension\r\n",
      "of infancy (he himself so believed and I do not think it can be\r\n",
      "questioned that he was the first to recognise it), what philosophic\r\n",
      "thinker has to a greater extent laid the world in debt? This I shall\r\n",
      "not further discuss. I am touching in these papers only upon light\r\n",
      "and exterior things, nor am I competent to deal with philosophical\r\n",
      "problems and controversies. John Fiske gave his strength to the\r\n",
      "writing of history, where, too, there are controversies into which I\r\n",
      "do not propose to enter. I will only say that I resent the account of\r\n",
      "him which makes him to have been a mere populariser whose merit lies\r\n",
      "solely or for the most part in the fact that, while appropriating\r\n",
      "materials accumulated by others, he had only Goldsmith's faculty\r\n",
      "of making them graceful and attractive to the mass of readers. His\r\n",
      "philosophical instinct, on the other hand, discovered, as few writers\r\n",
      "have done, the subtle links through which in history facts are related\r\n",
      "to facts and are weighed wisely, in the protagonists, the motives and\r\n",
      "qualities which make them foremost figures. He saw unerringly where\r\n",
      "emphasis should be put, what should be salient, what subordinate. Too\r\n",
      "many writers, German especially, perhaps, have the fault of \"writing\r\n",
      "a subject to its dregs,\" giving to the unimportant undue place. In\r\n",
      "Fiske's estimation of facts there is no failure of proper proportion,\r\n",
      "the great thing is always in the foreground, the trifle in shadow or\r\n",
      "quite unnoticed. To do this accurately is a fine power. He delved more\r\n",
      "deeply himself perhaps than many of his critics have been willing to\r\n",
      "acknowledge, but I incline to say that his main service to history was\r\n",
      "in detecting with unusual insight the subtle relations of cause\r\n",
      "and effect, links which other and sometimes very able men failed\r\n",
      "adequately to recognise. In a high sense he was indeed a populariser.\r\n",
      "He wore upon himself like an ample garment a splendid erudition under\r\n",
      "which he moved, however, not at all oppressed or trammelled. Much of\r\n",
      "the lore of Greece, Rome, the Orient, and also of modern peoples was\r\n",
      "as familiar to him as the contents of the morning papers. With acumen\r\n",
      "he selected and his memory retained; the cells of his capacious brain\r\n",
      "somehow held it ready for instant use. With good discrimination he\r\n",
      "could touch lightly or discourse profoundly as occasion required,\r\n",
      "his learning and insight always telling effectively, either at the\r\n",
      "breakfast-table of the plain citizen, or in the pages of the school\r\n",
      "text-book. \"John,\" said such a plain man the other day to a friend who\r\n",
      "also had been in touch with Fiske, \"the biggest thing that ever came\r\n",
      "into your life or mine was when that broad thinker familiarly darkened\r\n",
      "our doors.\" The two men stood reverently under John Fiske's portrait,\r\n",
      "the autograph signature underneath seeming in a way to connect the\r\n",
      "living with the dead, acknowledging the force of the personality which\r\n",
      "had made real to them as nothing else had ever done the deepest and\r\n",
      "finest things.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "John Fiske was often a guest in my home and I have sat, though less\r\n",
      "frequently, with him in his library in Berkeley Street in Cambridge,\r\n",
      "the flowers from the conservatory sending their perfumes among the\r\n",
      "crowded books and the south wind breathing pleasantly from the garden\r\n",
      "which had been Longfellow's, in the rear, to the garden of Howells in\r\n",
      "front. His passion for music was scarcely less than his interest in\r\n",
      "speculation and history. He knew well the great composers, and had\r\n",
      "himself composed. Though the master of no instrument, he could touch\r\n",
      "the piano with feeling. He had a pleasant baritone voice, and nothing\r\n",
      "gave him more refreshment after a week of study or lecturing than to\r\n",
      "pour himself out in song. His accompanist had need not only of great\r\n",
      "technical skill but of stout vertebrae, and strong wrists; for\r\n",
      "hours at a time the piano stool must be occupied while the difficult\r\n",
      "melodies of various lands were unriddled and interpreted. Those were\r\n",
      "interesting afternoons when, dropping his pen, he plunged into\r\n",
      "music as a strong confident swimmer plunges into the stream which\r\n",
      "he especially loves, interpreting with warm feeling Mendelssohn and\r\n",
      "Beethoven, wandering unlost in the vocal labyrinths of Dvorak and\r\n",
      "Wagner, but never happier than when interpreting the emotions of\r\n",
      "simple folk-songs, or some noble Shakespearian lyrics like \"Who\r\n",
      "is Sylvia, what is she, that all the swains commend her?\" Music\r\n",
      "stimulated him to vivacity and in the pauses would come outbursts of\r\n",
      "abandon. One day the pet dog of a daughter of mine ensconced himself\r\n",
      "unawares under the sofa and was disrespectfully napping while\r\n",
      "John Fiske sang. In a pause the philosopher broke into an animated\r\n",
      "declamation over some matter while standing near the sofa, whereat\r\n",
      "the pug thinking himself challenged tore out to the front with sudden\r\n",
      "violent barks. The two confronted each other, the pug frantically\r\n",
      "vindicating his dignity while the philosopher on his side fixing his\r\n",
      "eye upon the interrupter declaimed and gesticulated. As to volubility\r\n",
      "and sonorousness they stood about equal. I am bound to say the pug\r\n",
      "prevailed. John Fiske retired in discomfiture while the pug was\r\n",
      "carried off in triumph in the arms of his little mistress. He had\r\n",
      "fairly barked the great man down. I once shared with him the misery\r\n",
      "of being a butt. In St. Louis in those days the symposium was held in\r\n",
      "honour, and particularly N.O. Nelson, the well-known profit-sharing\r\n",
      "captain of industry, was the entertainer of select groups whose\r\n",
      "geniality was stimulated by modest potations of Anheuser-Bush, in St.\r\n",
      "Louis always the Castor and Pollux in every convivial firmament.\r\n",
      "Such a symposium was once held in special honour of Dr. Edward Waldo\r\n",
      "Emerson, a transient visitor. \"Dr. Emerson,\" said a guest, \"in the\r\n",
      "diary of your father just edited by you occurs a passage which needs\r\n",
      "illumination. 'Edward and I tried this morning for three quarters of\r\n",
      "an hour to get the calf into the barn without success. The Irish girl\r\n",
      "stuck her finger into his mouth and got the calf in in two minutes.\r\n",

      "laughter ridiculed the suggestion. Did I not know that nature had\r\n",

      "unsuspecting calf into the belief that the slyly inserted finger was\r\n",
      "that conduit? The triumph of the Irish girl was explained, and I sank\r\n",
      "back, covered with confusion. Fiske, however, blurted out: \"Why, I\r\n",

      "became the target of ridicule.\r\n",

      "I never saw John Fiske happier than once at Concord. Our host had\r\n",
      "invited us for a day and had prepared a programme that only Concord\r\n",
      "could furnish. The prelude was a performance of the Andante to a\r\n",
      "Sonata of Rubinstein, Opus 12, rendered exquisitely by the daughter of\r\n",
      "our host. I saw the great frame of my fellow-guest heave with emotion\r\n",
      "while his breath came almost in sobs as his spirit responded to\r\n",
      "the music. Then came a canoe-trip on the river to which John Fiske\r\n",
      "joyfully assented though some of the rest of us were not without\r\n",
      "apprehension. Fiske in a canoe was a ticklish proposition, but\r\n",
      "there he was at last, comfortably recumbent, his head propped up on\r\n",
      "cushions, serenely at ease though a very narrow margin intervened\r\n",
      "between water-line and gunwale. The performer of the Sonata, who was\r\n",
      "as deft at the paddle as she was at the piano, served as his pilot and\r\n",
      "propeller while the rest of us formed an escort which could be turned\r\n",
      "into a rescue party if occasion required. A stout, capacious rowboat\r\n",
      "followed immediately in the wake of the canoe. We went down the dark,\r\n",
      "placid current in the fine summer weather to the Battleground, and\r\n",
      "then looked into the solemn forest aisle which arches over the narrow\r\n",
      "Assabeth. The day was perfect, the flowers and birds were at their\r\n",
      "best, the pleasant nature was all about us. All this John Fiske drank\r\n",
      "in to the full but still more was he touched by the great associations\r\n",
      "of the environment. From the bank yonder had been \"fired the shot\r\n",
      "heard round the world.\" The hill-tops, meadows, the gentle river had\r\n",
      "been loved and frequented by Hawthorne, Thoreau, and Emerson; in\r\n",
      "these surroundings had bloomed forth the finest flowering of\r\n",
      "American literature. No heart could be more sensitive than was his\r\n",
      "to influences of this kind. As we moved cautiously about him,\r\n",
      "anxious about the equilibrium, though he was calm, he discoursed with\r\n",
      "animation. The afternoon waned gloriously into the dusk of the happy\r\n",

      "brother-in-law, who with wise and kindly art has added to the natural\r\n",
      "beauty. I saw John Fiske here in his home of homes to which his heart\r\n",

      "his great body, accumulating morbidly in a way which could not be\r\n",

      "mildewed volumes in, which he was digging, with suggestions as to how\r\n",
      "I might get out of the chaff the wheat that I wanted. He invited me to\r\n",

      "of the volume in his own great series which was just then in press.\r\n",
      "It related to matters that were vital to my purpose and I had the rare\r\n",

      "with modesty that he was descended from Cromwell through Ireton, and\r\n",
      "the vigour of his stride, with which I found it sometimes hard to keep\r\n",
      "up, made it plain that he was of stalwart stock and might have marched\r\n",

      "certain letters in which he made me feel that he regarded my\r\n",

      "of Oxford, William Stubbs, author of the great _Constitutional\r\n",

      "Edward A. Freeman, however, I came into cordial relations, a character\r\n",
      "well worthy of a sketch. He once came to America where with his fine\r\n",
      "English distinction behind him he met a good reception. He deported\r\n",
      "himself after the fashion of many another great Englishman, somewhat\r\n",
      "clumsily. At St. Louis he amusingly misapprehended conditions.\r\n",
      "Remembering the origin of the city he took it for granted that the\r\n",
      "audience which greeted him was for the most part of French descent,\r\n",
      "whereas probably not a dozen persons present had a trace of French\r\n",
      "blood in their veins. Because backwoodsmen a few generations before\r\n",
      "had possessed that region he took it for granted that we were\r\n",
      "backwoodsmen still. He addressed us under these misconceptions,\r\n",
      "the result being a \"talking down\" to a company of supposedly Latin\r\n",
      "extraction and quite illiterate. The fact was that the crowd,\r\n",
      "Anglo-Saxon with a strong infusion of German, was made up of people of\r\n",
      "high intelligence, the best whom the city could furnish, a city at the\r\n",
      "time noted for its interest in philosophical pursuits and the home\r\n",
      "of a highly educated class. Freeman's well-meant remarks would have\r\n",
      "seemed elementary to an audience of school-children. The address\r\n",
      "was quite inadequate and the unfortunate visitor had a rather cool\r\n",
      "reception. Freeman was only one of many in all this. The astronomer\r\n",
      "R.A. Proctor came to similar grief for a similar _gaucherie_, and\r\n",
      "even so famous a man as Lord Kelvin suffered in like manner. I have\r\n",
      "been told that at Yale University when addressing a college audience\r\n",
      "zealous for their own institution, he stumbled badly on the threshold\r\n",
      "by enlarging on the great privilege he was enjoying in speaking to the\r\n",
      "students of Cornell, proceeding blandly under the conviction that\r\n",
      "he was at Ithaca instead of under the elms of New Haven. But this\r\n",
      "clumsiness in Freeman and in others was only a surface blemish. He was\r\n",
      "a great writer treating with profound learning the story of Greece and\r\n",
      "Rome and South-western Europe in general, and illuminating as probably\r\n",
      "no other man has done the distant Saxon and early Norman dimnesses\r\n",
      "that lie in the background of our own past. I held him in thorough\r\n",
      "respect and when, following an article I had prepared in London\r\n",
      "for the _Pall Mall Gazette_, I received a polite note from him\r\n",
      "inviting me to come to see him at Somerleaze near Wells, I was much\r\n",
      "rejoiced. I went thither, passing through the beautiful green heart of\r\n",
      "England. In Wiltshire from the car-window I caught sight of a distant\r\n",
      "down on which, the substratum of chalk showing through the turf\r\n",
      "skilfully cut away, appeared the figure of a gigantic white horse, the\r\n",
      "memorial of an old Saxon battle; thence passing near Glastonbury\r\n",
      "and skirting the haunts of ancient Druids in the Mendip Hills, I was\r\n",
      "attuned for a meeting with a scholar who more than any other man of\r\n",
      "the time had aroused interest in the old life of England. I alighted\r\n",
      "at Wells where a trap was waiting, and drove between hedgerows for\r\n",
      "two miles to the secluded mansion. It lay back from the road, a roomy\r\n",
      "manor house thickly surrounded by groves and gardens. I was put at\r\n",
      "ease at once by the friendly welcome of Mrs. Freeman, a charming\r\n",
      "hostess who met me at the door. Freeman soon entered, a veteran of\r\n",
      "sixty, his florid English face set off by a long beard, and hair\r\n",
      "rather dishevelled, tawny, and streaked with gray. Like Gardiner he\r\n",
      "was of vigorous mould and we presently strode off together through the\r\n",
      "lanes of the estate with the sweet landscape all about us. His talk\r\n",
      "was animated and related for the most part to the objects which we\r\n",
      "passed and the points that came into view on the more distant hills.\r\n",
      "It was rather the talk of a local antiquary than of a historian in\r\n",
      "a comprehensive sense, though now and then a quickly uttered phrase\r\n",
      "linked a trifling detail with the great world movement; the spirit\r\n",
      "was most kindly. Returning to the house he stooped to the ground and\r\n",
      "picked up a handsome peacock's feather which he gave with a bow as a\r\n",
      "souvenir of the walk. At dinner we met Miss Freeman, an accomplished\r\n",
      "daughter. There was only one guest besides myself, a man whom I felt\r\n",
      "it was good fortune to meet. It was the Rev. William Hunt, since\r\n",
      "that time well known as a large contributor to Leslie Stephen's great\r\n",
      "Dictionary of National Biography, President of the English Historical\r\n",
      "Society, and author of many valuable works. It so happened that a few\r\n",
      "weeks before, my Life of Samuel Adams had come under his notice and\r\n",
      "gained his approval, which he had expressed in a cordial fashion\r\n",
      "in the Saturday Review by an article which had caused me much\r\n",
      "satisfaction. An evening followed full of interesting things. Miss\r\n",
      "Freeman played the piano for us with much skill, and then came a most\r\n",
      "animated talk which, though genial, was critically pungent. The United\r\n",
      "States was often sharply attacked and I was put to all my resources\r\n",
      "to parry the prods that were directed at our weak places. I did\r\n",
      "not escape some personal banter. Feeling that I was in a congenial\r\n",
      "atmosphere I announced with warmth my persistent love for England,\r\n",
      "though my stock had been fixed in America since 1635. I spoke of\r\n",
      "a cherished tradition of my family. The chronicler, Florence of\r\n",
      "Worcester, describes an ancient battle in the year of 1016 between\r\n",
      "Edmond Ironside and the Danes. The battle was close and the Danes at\r\n",
      "one point had taken captive a Saxon champion who looked very much like\r\n",
      "the king. By cutting off his head and holding it up before the Saxon\r\n",
      "army they well-nigh produced a panic, for the Saxons believed that\r\n",
      "their king was slain, and Edmond had a lively quarter of an hour in\r\n",
      "correcting the error and restoring order. He finally did so and won\r\n",
      "victory at last. The chronicler gave the name of the Saxon who thus\r\n",
      "suffered untimely decapitation as Hosmer. I told the story and Freeman\r\n",
      "at once insisted that it should be confirmed. He sent his daughter to\r\n",
      "the library, who returned bearing a huge tome containing the chronicle\r\n",
      "of Florence of Worcester. Freeman turned at once to the date, 1016,\r\n",
      "and there was the passage in the quaint mediaeval Latin. It was indeed\r\n",
      "a Hosmer who unwittingly had so nearly brought Edmond Ironside to\r\n",
      "grief. \"Was I descended from the man?\" queried Freeman. Quite proud\r\n",
      "that my story had been substantiated and perhaps a bit vainglorious\r\n",
      "over the fact that a man of my name had looked like a king, I was not\r\n",
      "slow in saying that I probably was, that my line for six hundred years\r\n",
      "after that date, honest yeomen, had lived near the spot, in the fields\r\n",
      "of Kent. Freeman assented to the probability, but it was suggested by\r\n",
      "others present that there was a further tradition. The Hosmer of 1016\r\n",
      "had lost his head, the Hosmers since that day had been constantly\r\n",
      "losing theirs, in fact, there had been no man of that name since that\r\n",
      "time in England who had any head worth speaking of, indeed they\r\n",
      "were said to be born without heads. Had this curious heredity been\r\n",
      "transmitted to the American line? I was forced to admit with confusion\r\n",
      "that I could cite no circumstances to rebut the suspicion, but all\r\n",
      "was good-natured though pungent, and when we broke up I retired to\r\n",
      "the guest chamber in a pleasant excitement. Freeman, who conducted me\r\n",
      "himself, brought the guest-book, calling my attention to the fact that\r\n",
      "the chamber had shortly before been occupied by Gladstone. The next\r\n",
      "morning we drove to Wells where, under the guidance of Freeman and Mr.\r\n",
      "Hunt, I studied for some hours the beautiful cathedral. It is not so\r\n",
      "large as many cathedrals, but few of them are more interesting. The\r\n",
      "front is finely impressive; a curious, inverted arch in the choir\r\n",
      "which descends from the ceiling to meet an arch rising from the floor\r\n",
      "at a point midway between the roof and pavement is a unique thing in\r\n",
      "architecture, a master-stroke of the mediaeval builder who solved\r\n",
      "a problem of construction and at the same time produced a thing of\r\n",
      "beauty. I remember, too, in a chapel, an example of a central column\r\n",
      "rising like a slender stem of a lily and foliating at the top into\r\n",
      "a graceful tracery, springing from the columns which surround and\r\n",
      "enclose the space. All this is elaborated with exquisite detail in the\r\n",
      "white stone. My guides, who were full of feeling for the architectural\r\n",
      "perfection, knew well the story of the builders and the interesting\r\n",
      "events with which through the centuries a masterpiece had been\r\n",
      "associated. It was a charming visit closed, appropriately, by this\r\n",
      "inspection under Freeman's guidance, of the cathedral of Wells.\r\n",

      "Goldwin Smith was a cosmopolite; a citizen as much of Canada and the\r\n",
      "United States as of England; a man indeed who would have preferred to\r\n",

      "bred and began his career; under the Union Jack he died, and he may\r\n",
      "rightly be classed as an English historian. My acquaintance with\r\n",
      "Goldwin Smith began a quarter of a century back, in the interchange\r\n",
      "of notes and books. I was interested in the same fields which he had\r\n",

      "that no other man had considered so well topics connected with the\r\n",
      "unity of English-speaking men in a broad bond of brotherhood. I did\r\n",
      "not set eyes on him until 1903, being for that year President of the\r\n",
      "American Library Association which was to meet at Niagara Falls. I\r\n",
      "invited Goldwin Smith to give the principal address. The librarians of\r\n",
      "Canada, as well as the United States, were to assemble on the frontier\r\n",
      "between the two countries, and it seemed desirable that a man standing\r\n",
      "under two flags should be spokesman and this character fitted Goldwin\r\n",
      "Smith precisely. But that year he became eighty years old. In the\r\n",
      "spring he was ill and did not dare to undertake in June an elaborate\r\n",
      "address. When we assembled at Niagara Falls, however, I found him\r\n",
      "there. He had come from Toronto to show his good-will and he spoke\r\n",
      "several times in our meetings; deliverances which, while neither long\r\n",
      "nor formal, were well worth hearing. He was a stately presence, tall,\r\n",
      "slender, and erect even at eighty, with a commanding face and head\r\n",
      "which had every trait of dignity. I had several opportunities for\r\n",
      "private talk and it appeared that his natural force was by no means\r\n",
      "abated. It would no doubt be more just to class him as a critic in\r\n",
      "politics, literature, and philosophy rather than an historian, but in\r\n",
      "the latter capacity, too, his service was great. His talk was fluent,\r\n",
      "incisive, and put forward without reference to what might be the\r\n",
      "prejudices or indeed the well-based principles of his listeners. He\r\n",
      "lashed bitterly the Congress of the United States for refusing through\r\n",
      "fear of Irish disapproval to do honour to John Bright. His tongue\r\n",
      "was a sword and cut sharply, and while he won respect always, often\r\n",
      "excited opposition and sometimes hatred. Napoleon in particular was a\r\n",
      "_bête noire_, to whom he denied even the possession of military\r\n",
      "genius. His courage was serene and he was quite indifferent as to\r\n",
      "whether he were hissed or applauded. He moved in a lofty atmosphere\r\n",
      "and the praise and blame of men counted for little with him, as on his\r\n",
      "high plane he discussed and judged. But it was impossible to entertain\r\n",
      "for Goldwin Smith any other feeling than profound respect, his\r\n",
      "accomplishments were vast, his memory unfailing, his ideals the\r\n",
      "highest, his sense of justice the keenest. His was a nature perhaps to\r\n",
      "evoke veneration rather than affection, and yet to men worthy of it he\r\n",
      "could be heartily cordial and friendly. The inscription on the stone\r\n",
      "erected to his memory at Cornell University is \"Above all nations is\r\n",
      "humanity.\" In his thought any limitation of the sympathies within the\r\n",
      "comparatively narrow bounds of one country was a vice rather than a\r\n",
      "virtue, and no nation was worthy to endure which did not stand for\r\n",
      "the good of the world at large; into love for all humanity narrower\r\n",
      "affections should emerge. He invited me to spend some days at the\r\n",
      "Grange at Toronto in his beautiful home, but circumstances made it\r\n",
      "impossible. I am glad to have seen Goldwin Smith at Niagara; that\r\n",
      "majestic environment befitted the subduing stateliness of his\r\n",
      "presence, his intellect, power, and elevation of view. He was one of\r\n",
      "the most exalted men I have ever known.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of my friend Bishop Phillips Brooks, I hope to say something\r\n",
      "by-and-by. I only mention now that when I asked him in 1886 for a\r\n",
      "letter or two to friends in England, whither I was going to collect\r\n",
      "material for a life of the colonial governor, he heartily said, \"I\r\n",
      "will give you a letter to the best Englishman I know, and that is\r\n",
      "James Bryce.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Arriving one July day in London, I posted my letter and received at\r\n",
      "once an invitation from Mr. Bryce to call upon him in Downing Street,\r\n",
      "where, as Under Secretary of State, he then made his official home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mark Twain's tears over the grave of Adam, a relative buried in a\r\n",
      "strange land, all will recall. On a basis as good perhaps, I walked\r\n",
      "through Downing Street with a certain sense of proprietorship, for did\r\n",
      "it not bear the name and had it not been the home of my brother in the\r\n",
      "pleasant Harvard bond, Sir George Downing, of the class of 1642? In\r\n",
      "the ante-room with its upholstery of dark-green leather I mused for\r\n",
      "a few minutes alone, over diplomatic conferences of which it had\r\n",
      "probably been the scene, but Mr. Bryce quickly entered, slight and\r\n",
      "sinewy, in his best years, kindly, courteous to the man sent by a\r\n",
      "friend whom he held among the closest. Bryce at that time was on the\r\n",
      "threshold of his fame. He had written _The Holy Roman Empire_\r\n",
      "which I knew well. He had been Regius Professor at Oxford, whose\r\n",
      "shades he had not long before forsaken for politics. That he had a\r\n",
      "special interest in and knowledge of America, the world did not know.\r\n",
      "He apologised for turning me off briefly then, but \"Come to dinner,\"\r\n",
      "said he, \"at my house to-night in Bryanstone Square.\" I was prompt to\r\n",
      "keep the appointment. A drizzle filtered through the night as the cab\r\n",
      "arrived at the door, but there was a cheery light in the windows and\r\n",
      "a warm welcome to the entering guest. There were three or four besides\r\n",
      "myself; a young officer just home from the campaign in the Soudan, Dr.\r\n",
      "Richter the authority in music and art, and the brother and sister of\r\n",
      "the host. I felt it a high distinction that I handed out to dinner\r\n",
      "the stately lady, the mother of my host. The conversation was general.\r\n",
      "Bits of African experience from the young soldier, glimpses into\r\n",
      "Richter's special fields, and a contribution or two from the\r\n",
      "Mississippi Valley, from me. In the talk that followed the dinner Mr.\r\n",
      "Bryce showed himself at home in German as much as in English, but what\r\n",
      "surprised me most was his puzzling curiosity about minutiae of our own\r\n",
      "politics. Why did the Mayor of Oshkosh on such and such dates veto\r\n",
      "the propositions of the aldermen as to the gas supply? And why did the\r\n",
      "supervisors of Pike County, Missouri, pass such and such ordinances as\r\n",
      "regards the keeping of dogs? These, or similar questions were fired at\r\n",
      "me rapidly, uttered with a keen attention as to my reply. I was quite\r\n",
      "confused and lame on what was supposedly my own ground. How queer, I\r\n",
      "thought, was the interest and the knowledge of this stranger. But in\r\n",
      "a few months I felt better. _The American Commonwealth_ appeared,\r\n",
      "revealing Bryce as a man who had set foot in almost our every State\r\n",
      "and Territory, and who had an intimacy with America such as no\r\n",
      "American even possessed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I am speaking here of historians, but may appropriately give a\r\n",
      "little space to an account of that wonderful acre or two of ground\r\n",
      "at Westminster, where for so many centuries the history of the\r\n",
      "English-speaking race has been to such an extent focused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In looking up Young Sir Henry Vane, it seemed fitting to have some\r\n",
      "knowledge of Parliament, and I welcomed the chance when, on the 19th\r\n",
      "of August, 1886, Parliament convened. It was a time of agitation. At\r\n",
      "the election just previous the Liberals, with Gladstone at the head\r\n",
      "of the Cabinet, had undergone defeat and the Conservatives had come in\r\n",
      "with Lord Randolph Churchill as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The\r\n",
      "first night was sure to be full of turmoil and excitement. Through\r\n",
      "Mr. Bryce's good offices I had a seat in the Strangers' Gallery. The\r\n",
      "student of history must always tread the precincts of Westminster with\r\n",
      "awe. There attached to the Abbey is the Chapter House. The central\r\n",
      "column divides overhead into the groins that form the arched ceiling,\r\n",
      "the stones at its base still bearing a stain from the rubbing elbows\r\n",
      "of mediaeval legislators, the floor worn by their hurrying feet, for\r\n",
      "from the time of Edward I. the Chapter House remained for centuries\r\n",
      "the legislative meeting-place. The old St. Stephen's Chapel to which\r\n",
      "Parliament at length removed was burned some eighty years since, but\r\n",
      "Westminster Hall, its attachment--the great hall of William Rufus,\r\n",
      "escaped and the new buildings of Parliament stand on the site of its\r\n",
      "former home. The present House of Commons occupies the ground of the\r\n",
      "old Chapel and in size and arrangement differs little from it. The\r\n",
      "Hall is small. The seven hundred members seated on the benches which\r\n",
      "slope up from the centre, crowd the floor space, while the galleries\r\n",
      "for the press at one end, for strangers at the other, and for the use\r\n",
      "of the Lords and the Diplomatic corps at the sides give only meagre\r\n",
      "accommodation. I passed into the building at nightfall, getting\r\n",
      "soul-stirring glimpses into the great area of Westminster Hall, in\r\n",
      "which burned only one far-away light. Its grandeur was more impressive\r\n",
      "in the dimness than in the glare. The lofty associations of the spot,\r\n",
      "coronations of kings, the reverberations of eloquence, the illustrious\r\n",
      "victims that had gone out from its tribunal to the scaffold thronged\r\n",
      "in my thought as I momentarily paused. But time pressed and I passed\r\n",
      "on to the central Hall where I stood in a jostling crowd, absorbed in\r\n",
      "the present with little thought of the fine frescoes that lined the\r\n",
      "walls or of the history that had been made in that environment. I was\r\n",
      "to send in my card to Mr. Bryce and while I stood puzzled as to what\r\n",
      "course to take, a good friend came to my side in the person of Sir\r\n",
      "Henry Norman. He had not then received his knightly title but was\r\n",
      "simply assistant to W.T. Stead on the _Pall Mall Gazette_,\r\n",
      "pushing his way, but already marked for a distinguished and eccentric\r\n",
      "career. He came to America as a youth and entered the Harvard\r\n",
      "Theological School. Inverting his pyramid, after beginning with the\r\n",
      "cone, he put in the base, taking up the work of undergraduate, and\r\n",
      "studying for an A.B. At Harvard he is best remembered as Creon in\r\n",
      "the _Oedipus Tyrannus_, where his handsome face and figure and\r\n",
      "mellifluous Greek won much admiration. Soon after, he cast to the\r\n",
      "winds both his Greek and theology and was in London fighting his way\r\n",
      "in the Press. Since then he has become famous for Oriental travel and\r\n",
      "observation, in which field he is an authority, and also as a member\r\n",
      "of Parliament. A friendship with him had been conciliated for me by a\r\n",
      "good letter from Edwin D. Mead, and I was glad to have him by my side\r\n",
      "that night. Through his help I soon was in the hands of Mr. Bryce and\r\n",
      "under his guidance found the way to my appointed seat. The House was\r\n",
      "in an uproar as I entered and from my point of vantage I looked down\r\n",
      "upon the scene, undignified, but full of most virile life. At the\r\n",
      "opposite end of the Hall sat Speaker Peel, in gown and wig, his\r\n",
      "sonorous cries of \"Order! order!\" availing little it seemed, to quiet\r\n",
      "the assembly. In the centre of the Chamber stood the famous table,\r\n",
      "the mace reposing at the end, the symbol that the House was in formal\r\n",
      "session. On one side sat the members of the new Cabinet, the foremost\r\n",
      "and most interesting figure, Lord Randolph Churchill. Opposite to\r\n",
      "them across the width of the table were the leaders of the opposition,\r\n",
      "Gladstone at the fore. The benches were densely crowded with members.\r\n",
      "Under my feet where I could not see them were the Irish members, not\r\n",
      "visible but noisily audible. Many men of note were in their seats that\r\n",
      "night. A powerful voice was ringing through the Chamber as I took my\r\n",
      "seat, which I soon found was that of Bradlaugh. His utterance was a\r\n",
      "sustained declamation. But there were ejaculations, sometimes mere\r\n",
      "hoots and cat-calls, sometimes crisply-shouted sentences rose into the\r\n",
      "air. \"I belong to a society for the abolition of the House of Lords,\"\r\n",
      "came thundering up. It was from Sir Wilfred Lawson, the radical from\r\n",
      "Carlisle, whose statue now stands on the Thames Embankment. Lord\r\n",
      "Randolph Churchill made that night what I suppose was the great speech\r\n",
      "of his life, for some two hours facing the Irish members waging a\r\n",
      "forensic battle, memorable for even the House of Commons. From my\r\n",
      "perch I looked directly into his face at a distance of not many feet\r\n",
      "as he confronted the Irish crowd. Rather short of stature, he was a\r\n",
      "compact figure, and his face had in it combative energy as the marked\r\n",
      "characteristic. He outlined the policy of the new government with\r\n",
      "serene indifference to the stormy disapproval which almost every\r\n",
      "sentence evoked. When the outcry became deafening, he paused with a\r\n",
      "grim smile on his bull-dog face until the interruption wore itself\r\n",
      "out. \"This disturbance makes no difference to me,\" he would quietly\r\n",
      "say, \"I am only sorry to have the time of the House wasted in such\r\n",
      "unreasonable fashion.\" Then would come another prod and a new chorus\r\n",
      "of howls rolling thunderously from the cavern under my feet. It is\r\n",
      "not in line with my present plan to describe this speech; that may be\r\n",
      "found in Hansard under the date. I touch only on the outside manner\r\n",
      "as he fought his fight. It was a fine example of cool, imperturbable,\r\n",
      "unshrinking assault, and I thought that in some such way his ancestor,\r\n",
      "the great Duke of Marlboro, might have ruled the hour at Blenheim and\r\n",
      "Malplaquet. Many years after it fell to me to introduce to an audience\r\n",
      "his son Winston Churchill who, when his father was Chancellor of the\r\n",
      "Exchequer, was a schoolboy at Harrow. I took occasion to describe\r\n",
      "briefly the battle I had seen his father wage at Westminster. It\r\n",
      "pleased Winston Churchill then fresh from the fields of South Africa.\r\n",
      "\"That was indeed a great speech of my father's,\" he said. Since then\r\n",
      "the son has developed into a combatant probably not less formidable\r\n",
      "than his forebears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was well worth while for me, desiring to see the Parliament of\r\n",
      "England in its most interesting moods, but something came later which\r\n",
      "I treasure more. While the conflict proceeded, in his place near\r\n",
      "the mace but a yard or two distant from the conspicuous figure sat\r\n",
      "Gladstone. I had seen him enter the House, a massive frame dressed in\r\n",
      "a dark frock-coat which hung handsomely upon his broad shoulders, with\r\n",
      "the strong head and face above, set in a lion-like mane of disordered\r\n",
      "hair. He sat unmoved and quiet throughout the conflict as he might\r\n",
      "have done at a ladies' tea-party, but now he rose to speak. At once\r\n",
      "complete silence pervaded the Chamber. I believe I have never seen so\r\n",
      "impressive an exhibition of the power of a great personality. Foes as\r\n",
      "well as friends waited almost breathless for the words that were to\r\n",
      "come. It was a time of crisis. He had just met defeat. What could the\r\n",
      "discredited leader say?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He began in a voice scarcely above a whisper, though in the silence it\r\n",
      "was distinctly audible, but the tones strengthened and deepened as he\r\n",
      "proceeded. His audience hung upon his every word, and so he discoursed\r\n",
      "for half an hour. It was not a great speech,--a series of calm,\r\n",
      "unimpassioned statements in which clearness of phrase and absolute\r\n",
      "abstention from aggressive attack upon his opponents were the most\r\n",
      "marked characteristics. It was courteous toward friend and foe,\r\n",
      "and foes no less than friends received each clear-cut sentence with\r\n",
      "attention most respectful. I was a bit disappointed not to see the old\r\n",
      "lion aroused and in his grandeur. But it is a thing to prize that I\r\n",
      "witnessed a manifestation made in his full strength and in the acme of\r\n",
      "his dominance. It was worth while to see that even in no great mood,\r\n",
      "the force of his leadership was recognised and reserve power of the\r\n",
      "man fully felt. Like every Achilles, Gladstone was held by the heel\r\n",
      "when dipped. One may well feel that he came short as a theologian. The\r\n",
      "scholars slight his Homeric disquisitions. Consistency was a virtue\r\n",
      "which he probably too often scouted, but his high purpose, his\r\n",
      "spotlessness of spirit, and strong control of men no one can gainsay.\r\n",
      "In the slang of the street of that time he was the \"G.O.M.,\" the Grand\r\n",
      "Old Man as well to those who fought him as to those who loved him.\r\n",
      "An impressive incident of the session occurred in the address of the\r\n",
      "\"Mover of the Queen's Speech.\" The orator in brilliant court attire,\r\n",
      "a suit of plum-coloured velvet with full wig and small-clothes which\r\n",
      "seemed almost the only bit of colour in the soberly, sometimes rather\r\n",
      "shabbily, dressed assemblage, a costume which through long tradition\r\n",
      "attaches to the function which he discharged, prefaced his remarks\r\n",
      "with this tribute: \"However we may differ from the honourable member\r\n",
      "for Midlothian, we are all willing to admit that he is the most\r\n",
      "illustrious of living Englishmen.\" In spite of the general bitterness\r\n",
      "of the tumultuous controversy, one felt that there lay beneath it\r\n",
      "all a certain fine magnanimity. Both Liberal and Tory believed in\r\n",
      "the substantial patriotism and good purpose of the adversary as a\r\n",
      "fundamental concession and that all were seeking the best welfare\r\n",
      "of England. The differences regarded only the expedients which were\r\n",
      "proper for the moment. One could see that foes furious in the arena\r\n",
      "might at the same time be closest personal friends. It was not a\r\n",
      "riddle that in the tea-rooms and the smoking-rooms Greek and Trojan\r\n",
      "could sit together in friendly _tête-à-tête_, or that such\r\n",
      "incidents could occur as the genial congratulations extended by\r\n",
      "Gladstone to Joseph Chamberlain over the fine promise of his son\r\n",
      "Austin Chamberlain making his début in Parliament; congratulations\r\n",
      "extended when the two statesmen were at swords' points,--a friendly\r\n",
      "talk as it were, through helmet bars when the slash was at the\r\n",
      "sharpest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I went home that night, through the streets of London, my mind and\r\n",
      "heart were full. My special studies at the moment were familiarising\r\n",
      "me with what lay behind the scene which I had just beheld. In similar\r\n",
      "fashion in the days of Edward I. and Simon De Montfort, the Commons of\r\n",
      "England, then struggling up, had wrestled in the narrow Chapter House.\r\n",

      "while a round, genial face beamed good-naturedly. The interview was in\r\n",
      "the Professor's handsome garden, his accomplished wife and daughters\r\n",
      "were of the party, and I remember _Maiwein_ with pretzels on a\r\n",
      "lawn with rose-bushes close beside and music coming through the open\r\n",
      "windows of the house. The hospitality was graceful, there was no\r\n",
      "profound talk but only pleasant chatter. The daughters were glad to\r\n",
      "have a chance to try their English and I was glad for the moment to\r\n",
      "slip out of the foreign bond and disport myself for their benefit in\r\n",
      "my vernacular, but the Professor needed no practice. His English was\r\n",
      "quite adequate, as, on the other hand, the German of Bancroft was well\r\n",
      "in hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What other university people would you like to see?\" said Bancroft to\r\n",
      "me one day. I mentioned von Ranke, Lepsius, and Mommsen as men whose\r\n",
      "names were familiar, whose faces I should like to look upon.\r\n",

      "\"Find out the _sprech-stunden_ of these men,\" said Bancroft to\r\n",
      "his secretary, and presently a slip was put into my hand containing\r\n",
      "the hours at which I could be conveniently received. Following the\r\n",
      "direction, I was one day admitted to the library of von Ranke, a plain\r\n",
      "apartment walled by books from floor to ceiling, with a desk well-worn\r\n",
      "by days and nights of work. As I awaited his entrance the facts of\r\n",
      "his career were vivid in my mind. He was a man of seventy-five and had\r\n",
      "been a scholar almost from his cradle. He was known to me particularly\r\n",
      "through his history of the popes, which was and perhaps is still the\r\n",
      "judicial authority with regard to the line of pontiffs, but that was\r\n",
      "only one book among many. He belonged to a class of which Germany has\r\n",
      "been prolific, whose consciences assault them if they let their pens\r\n",
      "lie idle, and who have no recourse in self-defence but building about\r\n",
      "themselves a barricade of books. After researches in various fields,\r\n",
      "von Ranke now was undertaking a history of the world, with no thought\r\n",
      "apparently of a probable touch from the dart of death in the near\r\n",
      "future; and he did indeed live until nearly ninety and long produced a\r\n",
      "volume a year.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He entered presently from an inner room, rather a short, well-rounded\r\n",
      "figure with a face marked by a clear eye and much vivacity. He\r\n",
      "conversed well in English and was curious about American education and\r\n",
      "offered, rather ludicrously, I remember, to exchange the publications\r\n",
      "of the University of Berlin with those of the little fresh-water\r\n",
      "college in which I was at that time a young teacher. Could the scholar\r\n",
      "be aiming a sly sarcastic hit at the bareness of our educational\r\n",
      "outposts in the West? But no, his frank look and voice showed that he\r\n",
      "was unaware of the real conditions. The talk was not long, there was a\r\n",
      "hearty expression of regard for Mr. Bancroft who was fully accepted by\r\n",
      "the German learned world as one of their _Gelehrten_, trained as\r\n",
      "he had been in youth in their schools, and in that day our best-known\r\n",
      "historian. I bowed myself out respectfully from the presence of the\r\n",
      "little man and sincerely hope that the merit of his great history is\r\n",
      "in no way abated because I took a half-hour of his time.\r\n",

      "I met Lepsius, the great Egyptian scholar, one afternoon in his\r\n",
      "garden, a hale, straight man of sixty with abundant grey hair\r\n",
      "surmounting a fine forehead, with blue eyes full of penetration behind\r\n",
      "his spectacles. I had little knowledge of the subject he had studied\r\n",
      "so profoundly and almost laughed outright when his pretty daughter\r\n",
      "asked me if I had read her father's translation of the _Book of the\r\n",
      "Dead_. Of von Ranke's themes I thought I knew something and was\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Theodor Mommsen, more than any other, forty years ago, was the leading\r\n",
      "historian of Germany. He began his career as a student of law, in\r\n",
      "the antiquities of which he became thoroughly versed. In particular\r\n",
      "Justinian and the Roman authorities, among whom he stands as chief,\r\n",
      "were the objects of Mommsen's research. From jurisprudence he passed\r\n",
      "to the study of general history, and of the most interesting period of\r\n",
      "Rome he absorbed into his mind all the lore that has survived. This\r\n",
      "he digested and set forth in a monumental work, which, translated into\r\n",
      "English, has been, in the English-speaking world of scholars at least,\r\n",
      "as familiar as household words. At a still later time he was an active\r\n",
      "striver in the political agitations of his day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sent in my card to Mommsen with some trepidation and was at\r\n",
      "once admitted. I found him sitting at leisure among his books and\r\n",
      "Bancroft's introduction brought to pass for me a genial welcome. He\r\n",
      "was a man not large in frame with dark eyes, and black hair streaked\r\n",
      "with grey. No doubt but that like German scholars in general he could\r\n",
      "talk English, but he stuck to German and I was rather glad he did\r\n",
      "so; I could take him in better as he discoursed fluently in his\r\n",
      "mother-tongue. Mommsen was a man of sharp corners who often in his\r\n",
      "political career brought grief to adversaries who tried to handle him\r\n",
      "without gloves. I was fortunate in catching him in a softer mood and\r\n",
      "witnessed an amiability with which he was not usually credited. His\r\n",
      "little daughters were in the room, pretty children with whom\r\n",
      "the father played with evident pride and joy, interrupting the\r\n",
      "conversation to caress the curly pates, and trotting them on his knee.\r\n",
      "He put keen questions to me as regards America, showing that while\r\n",
      "busy with Caesar and the on-goings of the ancient forum he had been\r\n",
      "wide awake also to modern happenings. He expressed much regard for\r\n",
      "Bancroft and praised Grant for selecting as minister to Germany a\r\n",
      "personality so agreeable to European scholars. He told me of the\r\n",
      "jubilee of Bancroft which was about to be celebrated with marked\r\n",
      "honours. Fifty years before Bancroft had \"made his doctor\" at\r\n",
      "Göttingen, one of the earliest Americans to achieve that distinction,\r\n",
      "and the German universities meant to show emphatically their\r\n",
      "recognition of his merit. The celebration afterwards took place, not\r\n",
      "interrupted by the warlike uproar in which the land was about to be\r\n",
      "involved. A proud honour indeed for the American minister. It was\r\n",
      "a noteworthy occasion to talk thus familiarly with one of the most\r\n",
      "illustrious scholars of the time, and I recall fondly the pleasant\r\n",
      "details of the picture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Heidelberg the February before I had had an interview with\r\n",
      "Schenkel, then the leading theologian of that university. Him I found\r\n",
      "in his _Studir-Zimmer_ without fire on a cold day. He seemed to\r\n",
      "scorn the use of the _Kachelofen_, the great porcelain stove, and\r\n",
      "was wrapped from head to foot in a heavy woollen robe which enveloped\r\n",
      "him and was prolonged about his head into a kind of cowl. He presented\r\n",
      "a figure closely like the portraits of some old reformers heavily\r\n",
      "mantled in a garb approaching the monkish _Tracht_ which they\r\n",
      "had forsaken. It seemed out of character for Schenkel, for he was an\r\n",
      "avowed liberal and particularly far away from old standards, but the\r\n",
      "sharp winter drove a champion of heterodoxy into this outer conformity\r\n",
      "with the old. In the case of the Berlin _Gelehrten_, however,\r\n",
      "the mediaeval dress was quite discarded. I chanced to see them in\r\n",
      "the spring with their windows wide open to the perfume of gardens and\r\n",
      "songs of nightingales, and in the case of Mommsen, my picture of\r\n",

      "One of the most interesting men whom I met in Berlin was Hermann\r\n",
      "Grimm, then just rising among the characters of mark, but best known\r\n",
      "at that time as the son of the famous Wilhelm Grimm and the nephew\r\n",
      "of Jakob Grimm,--the \"Brothers Grimm,\" whose names through their\r\n",
      "connection with the fairy tales are stamped in the memories not only\r\n",
      "of men and women, but of children throughout the civilised world.\r\n",
      "The \"Brothers Grimm,\" it must be remembered, were scholars of the\r\n",
      "profoundest. The Teutonic folk-lore engaged them not simply or\r\n",
      "mainly as a source of amusement, but as a subject proper for deep\r\n",
      "investigation. They painfully gathered in out-of-the-way nooks from\r\n",
      "the lips of old grandames in chimney corners and wandering singers in\r\n",
      "obscure villages, the survivals of the primitive superstitions of the\r\n",
      "people. These they subjected to scientific study as illustrating\r\n",
      "the evolution of society, a deep persistent search with results\r\n",
      "elaborately systematised, of which the delightful tales so widely\r\n",
      "circulated are only a by-product. Aside from their service in the\r\n",
      "field of folk-lore they grappled with many another mighty task. The\r\n",
      "vast dictionary, in which German words are not only set down in their\r\n",
      "present meaning but followed throughout every stage of their etymology\r\n",
      "with their relations to their congeners in other tongues indefatigably\r\n",
      "traced out, is a marvel of erudition. Theirs also was the great\r\n",
      "_Deutsche Grammatik_, a philosophical setting forth of the German\r\n",
      "tongue in its connection with its far-spreading Aryan affinities. The\r\n",
      "\"Brothers Grimm\" were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their\r\n",
      "deaths they are not divided. Jakob was never married. Wilhelm was\r\n",
      "married, the child of the union being the distinguished man with whom\r\n",
      "it was my fortune to talk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They worked together affectionately until far into old age, and I have\r\n",

      "side by side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I found Hermann Grimm in the study which had been the workshop through\r\n",
      "long years of his father and uncle. He was a handsome man in his\r\n",
      "vigorous years and had married the daughter of Bettine von Arnim,\r\n",
      "the Bettine of Goethe. It is not strictly right to class him as a\r\n",
      "historian. He was poet, playwright, critic, and novelist, perhaps\r\n",
      "mainly these, but soon after, in his position as a professor in the\r\n",
      "university, he was to produce his well-known _Vorlesungen über\r\n",
      "Göthe_, a work which though mainly critical, at the present time\r\n",
      "is a biography of conspicuous merit, which envisages the events of a\r\n",
      "famous epoch. I may, therefore, properly include him here, though\r\n",
      "the wide range of his activities makes it difficult to place him\r\n",
      "accurately. It paved the way for our interview that I knew Ralph Waldo\r\n",
      "Emerson, of whom he was, in Germany, the special admirer and student.\r\n",
      "He had just translated Emerson into German and sat at the feet of the\r\n",
      "Concord sage, infused by his inspiration. Hermann Grimm had never seen\r\n",
      "Emerson, and listened eagerly to such details as I could give him of\r\n",
      "his personality. He dwelt with enthusiasm upon passages in poems\r\n",
      "and essays by which he had been especially kindled, and hung upon my\r\n",
      "account of the voice and refined outward traits of the teacher whom\r\n",
      "he so reverenced. I afterwards procured a fine photograph of Hermann\r\n",
      "Grimm which I sent to Emerson. A kind letter from him, which I still\r\n",
      "treasure, let me know that I had put Emerson deeply in my debt; up to\r\n",
      "that time he had never seen a portrait of his German disciple, though\r\n",
      "the two men had been in affectionate correspondence. At a later\r\n",

      "which their hands had moved; their inkstands and pens; the rough\r\n",
      "arm-chairs and tables where they had sat. I think a trace from the\r\n",
      "smoke of their pipes and midnight lamp still adhered to the ceiling,\r\n",

      "which at once drew my attention. It was that of a man in his best\r\n",

      "met. His niceness of attire rather amused the boys of those days who,\r\n",

      "This story was current. He had for some time been a famous man and\r\n",
      "was subjected to much persecution from sight-seers which he bore\r\n",
      "good-naturedly. Standing one day at the Craigie House gate he was\r\n",

      "was the principal stay of the treble, his clear, strong voice carrying\r\n",
      "far; my function was to afford to him a rather uncertain support. My\r\n",
      "voice was not of the best nor was my ear quite sure. I ventured\r\n",
      "once to criticise a fellow-singer as being off the _pitch_; he\r\n",

      "heroine of _Hyperion_, whose tragic fate a few years later\r\n",
      "shocked the world. He used to sit withdrawn into the corner of his\r\n",
      "high-backed pew, separated from us in the choir loft by only a short\r\n",
      "intervening space, motionless, absorbed in some far-away thought.\r\n",
      "Though his eyes were sometimes closed I knew that he was not asleep;\r\n",
      "what could be the topic on which his meditation was so intent? Not\r\n",

      "his happy successful life. His wife one evening in light summer dress\r\n",
      "was writing a letter, and, lighting a candle to seal it, dropped the\r\n",
      "match among her draperies. The flame spread at once and she expired in\r\n",
      "agony; Longfellow was himself badly burned in his effort to extinguish\r\n",
      "the flames and always carried the scars. I did not see him in those\r\n",
      "years but have heard that his mood changed, he was no longer careful\r\n",
      "and debonair but often melancholy and dishevelled. Yet the sweetness\r\n",
      "of his spirit persisted to the end. The critics of late have been busy\r\n",
      "with Longfellow. His gift was inferior, they say, and his sentiment\r\n",
      "shallow. Let them carp as they will, he holds, as few poets have\r\n",
      "done, the hearts of men and women; still more he holds the hearts\r\n",
      "of children, and the life of multitudes continues to be softened and\r\n",

      "Sanders Theatre of the centenary of Longfellow's birth. There was fine\r\n",
      "encomium from distinguished men, but to me the charming part of the\r\n",
      "occasion was the tribute of the school children who thronged upon the\r\n",

      "to his account. During the children's performance a voice noticeably\r\n",
      "clear and fine sounded in the high upper gallery, a happy suggestion\r\n",
      "of the voice of the mother singing in paradise as the daughter sang\r\n",
      "below. Honour to the poet who, while so many singers of our time\r\n",

      "rapturous pleasure than in the strenuous pulls I had on the Charles,\r\n",

      "who, forsaking for a time their hermeneutics and homilies, gave\r\n",
      "themselves to the outdoor sport. Our club included a number of\r\n",

      "shooting numerously over the surface, cutting it sharply, the cut\r\n",
      "presently closing behind in a faint cicatrice that extended far. I\r\n",
      "thought of the beautiful simile in the _Autocrat of the Breakfast\r\n",
      "Table_, just then appearing in the _Atlantic_. Holmes had seen\r\n",
      "such things too, and said that they were like the wounds of the angels\r\n",
      "during the wars in heaven as described in _Paradise Lost_, gashes\r\n",
      "deep in the celestial bodies but closing instantly. In those years Dr.\r\n",

      "ringing back the Autocrat's voice, \"I did not know you were old enough\r\n",
      "to be out in a boat!\" Charlie was old enough, in fact our best oar,\r\n",

      "who had seen him grow up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dr. Holmes was one of the most versatile of men. We saw him here\r\n",
      "at home with the oar in the open. He was an excellent professor of\r\n",
      "anatomy, renowned for his insight and readiness in adapting means to\r\n",
      "ends in the difficult science where his main work lay. Literature\r\n",
      "was merely his hobby, and he was wit, critic, philosopher, historian,\r\n",
      "poet, good in all. Many a brilliant man has come to wreck through\r\n",
      "being too versatile. \"_Ne sutor ultra crepidam_\" is undoubtedly\r\n",
      "a good motto for the ordinary man, but sticking to his last was\r\n",
      "something to which Dr. Holmes could never bring himself, and in a\r\n",
      "marvellous way his abounding genius proved masterful in a score of\r\n",
      "varying fields. But I have no purpose here to discuss or account\r\n",
      "for Dr. Holmes. He was a delightful phenomenon in the life of the\r\n",
      "nineteenth century, with whom I chanced to be somewhat in touch,\r\n",
      "and it is for me only to note a bit of the scintillation which I saw\r\n",
      "brilliantly diffused. He was frequently under my gaze, a low-statured,\r\n",
      "nimble figure, a vivacious, always cheerful face with a pronounced\r\n",
      "chin, seemingly ever on the brink of some outburst of merriment. I\r\n",
      "have heard him described as an \"incarnate pun,\" but that hardly did\r\n",
      "him justice; punster he was, but he had a wit of a far higher kind\r\n",
      "and moods of grave dignity. His literary fame in those years was\r\n",
      "only incipient, his better work was just then beginning. The world\r\n",
      "appreciated him as a humourist of the lighter kind and capable, too,\r\n",
      "of spirited verse like _Old Ironsides_; it was not understood\r\n",
      "that he possessed profounder powers and could stir men to the depths.\r\n",
      "I have a vivid image of him at a banquet of the Harvard Alumni\r\n",
      "Association of which he was Second Vice-President, clothed in white\r\n",
      "summer garb, standing in a chair that his little figure might be\r\n",
      "in evidence in the crowd, merrily rattling off a string of amusing\r\n",
      "verses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  \"I thank you, Mr. President,\r\n",
      "  You kindly broke the ice,\r\n",

      "These were the opening lines and the audience responded with roars to\r\n",
      "the inimitable fun-maker. In later years we learned to accord him a\r\n",
      "higher appreciation. The _Autocrat_ and the _Professor at the\r\n",
      "Breakfast Table_ have deep and acute thought as well as wit, and\r\n",
      "what one of our poets has produced a grander or more solemn lyric than\r\n",
      "the _Chambered Nautilus_? I dwell with emotion upon the funeral\r\n",
      "of Lowell, in itself a touching occasion, because it so happened that\r\n",
      "I saw on that day three great men for the last time, Justin Winsor,\r\n",
      "Phillips Brooks, and Dr. Holmes. I stood on the stairs at the rear of\r\n",
      "Appleton Chapel as the audience came down the aisle at the close. The\r\n",
      "coffin of Lowell rested for a moment on the grass under its wreaths,\r\n",
      "President Eliot and Holmes walked side by side; I have a distinct\r\n",
      "image of the countenance of Holmes as they came slowly out. It was no\r\n",
      "longer a young face but it had all the old vivacity and even at the\r\n",
      "moment was cheerful rather than serious; it had not, however, the\r\n",
      "cheerfulness of a man who looks lightly on life, but that of one whose\r\n",
      "philosophy enables him to conquer sorrow and look beyond, the face\r\n",
      "of a man who might write a triumphant hymn even in an atmosphere of\r\n",
      "death. These lines ran in my thought:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  \"Build thee more stately mansions, oh my soul,\r\n",
      "  As the swift seasons roll!\r\n",
      "  Leave thy low vaulted past,\r\n",

      "The fame of James Russell Lowell, too, in these years was incipient.\r\n",
      "As a writer he had shown himself to be elegantly schooled, but in the\r\n",
      "_Fable for Critics_ and the _Biglow Papers_, he had burst\r\n",
      "forth as a most effective and slashing satirist. His culture was\r\n",
      "closely and perfectly fitted, but when scratched, revealing in full\r\n",
      "proportions the \"Whang-doodle\" Yankee. The whang, however, handling\r\n",
      "with all the deftness in the world the broadest and subtlest themes,\r\n",
      "and the doodle standing for a patriotism of the noblest. Those\r\n",
      "who came into close connection with him say that he grew morbidly\r\n",
      "fastidious, shrinking from coarse contacts and was happy at last only\r\n",
      "in a delicate environment. When in health, nevertheless, he was a\r\n",
      "Yankee of the truest, though sublimated by his genius and superb\r\n",
      "accomplishments. I know a little inn far away among the hills on whose\r\n",
      "porch half concealed by the honeysuckle, Lowell is said often to have\r\n",
      "sat listening to the dialect of the farmers who \"vanned\" and \"vummed\"\r\n",
      "as they disputed together in the evenings after the chores were done.\r\n",
      "Lowell had the dialect in his very bones, and loved it, but took pains\r\n",
      "to confirm his knowledge of it by studying on the sod.\r\n",

      "On one occasion I heard Lowell tell a story in which he surrendered\r\n",
      "himself fully to the rustic heredity that was in him, flinging aside\r\n",
      "the accretions of culture. \"It is strange,\" he said, \"how even the\r\n",
      "moral sense of men may become warped. In a certain Cape Cod village,\r\n",
      "for instance, it had long been the custom to profit from the wrecks\r\n",
      "that happened upon the dangerous shore, until at last the setting\r\n",
      "of false lights and the appropriation of the lost cargoes became a\r\n",
      "legitimate business. One Sunday a congregation at church (they were\r\n",
      "rigid Puritans and punctilious about worship) was startled by the news\r\n",
      "that a West India ship loaded with sugar was going to pieces on the\r\n",
      "rocks near by. The birds of prey flocked to make prize of the booty.\r\n",
      "A good deacon bagged a large quantity of sugar, piling it on the shore\r\n",
      "while he went for his oxen to carry it home. The bad boys, however,\r\n",
      "resolved to play a trick on the deacon; they emptied out the sugar and\r\n",
      "filled the bags with clean, brown sand, which counterfeited well. This\r\n",
      "the deacon laboriously carted to his barn, and only came to a sense of\r\n",
      "his loss when his wife at night attempted to sweeten his tea from\r\n",
      "the bags. This brought out from the deacon the following remark: 'I\r\n",
      "declare, when I felt that 'ar sand agrittin' between my teeth, I don't\r\n",
      "know but it was wicked, but I e'en a'most wished that there wouldn't\r\n",
      "never be another wreck!'\" Lowell told the story with all the humour\r\n",
      "possible, rendering the deacon's remark with a twang and an emphatic\r\n",
      "dwelling on the double negative (a thing which Lowell believed we had\r\n",
      "suffered to drop out of polite speech unfortunately) with inimitable\r\n",
      "effect and most evident enjoyment. The substratum of the man was\r\n",
      "Yankee but probably no other of the stock has so enriched himself with\r\n",
      "the best of all lands and times. He had a most delicate sense of what\r\n",
      "was best worth while in all literatures and absorbed it to the full.\r\n",
      "One of the greatest mistakes I ever made was in neglecting to become a\r\n",
      "member of his class in Dante when the opportunity came to me. What\r\n",
      "an interpreter he was of the soul of the great Italian, and with what\r\n",
      "unerring instinct he penetrated to what was best in the sages and\r\n",
      "poets of the world everywhere! His own gifts as poet and thinker were\r\n",
      "of the finest, and they were set off with acquirements marvellous\r\n",
      "in their range and in the unerring precision with which they were\r\n",
      "selected. I recall him at a very impressive moment. Many regard\r\n",
      "Lowell's _Commemoration Ode_, read at the Commemoration in 1865\r\n",
      "of the Harvard soldiers who had taken part in the Civil War, as the\r\n",
      "high-water mark of American poetry. Whether or not that claim is just\r\n",
      "I shall not debate, but it is a great composition and perhaps Lowell's\r\n",
      "best. The occasion was indeed a noble one. A multitude had collected\r\n",
      "in the college-yard and through it wound the brilliant procession\r\n",
      "of soldiers who had taken part in the war, marching to the drum and\r\n",
      "wearing for the last time the uniform in which they had fought. From\r\n",
      "Major-Generals and Admirals down to the high privates, all were in\r\n",
      "blue, and the sun glittered resplendent on epaulet and lace worn\r\n",
      "often by men who walked with difficulty, halting from old wounds. The\r\n",
      "exercises in the church, the singing of Luther's hymn, _A Mighty\r\n",
      "Fortress is our God_, the oration and the impressive prayer of\r\n",
      "Phillips Brooks were finished. The assembly collected under the great\r\n",
      "tent which filled the quadrangle formed by the street, Harvard and\r\n",
      "Hollis Halls and Holden Chapel. I sat at the corner by the side\r\n",
      "of Phillips Brooks. He was the Chaplain of the day and I had been\r\n",
      "honoured by a commission to speak for the rank and file. The speeches,\r\n",
      "though not always happy, preserved a good level of excellence. At\r\n",
      "length came Lowell. He stood with his back toward Hollis about midway\r\n",
      "of the space. He was then in his best years, brown-haired, dark-eyed,\r\n",
      "rather short-necked, with a full strong beard, his intellectual face,\r\n",
      "an Elizabethan face, surmounting a sturdy body. His manner was not\r\n",
      "impassioned, he read from a manuscript with distinctness which could\r\n",
      "be heard everywhere, but I do not recall that his face kindled or his\r\n",
      "voice trembled. Even in the more elevated passages, I think we\r\n",
      "hardly felt as he proceeded that it was the culmination of the day's\r\n",
      "utterances and that we were really then and there in an epoch-making\r\n",
      "event. Unfortunately for me my speech was yet to come and, unpractised\r\n",
      "as I was, I was uncomfortably nervous as to what I should say. I\r\n",
      "lost therefore the full effect of the masterpiece. One or two of the\r\n",
      "speakers on the programme had dropped out and behold it was my\r\n",
      "turn. The announcement of my name with a brief introduction from the\r\n",
      "chairman struck my ear, and it was for me to stand on my feet and do\r\n",
      "my best. My voice sounded out into the great space in which the echo\r\n",
      "of Lowell's was scarcely silent. I spoke for the rank and file and in\r\n",
      "my whole career of nearly eighty years it was perhaps the culminating\r\n",
      "moment, when fate placed me in a juxtaposition so memorable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In 1857 I sent a poem to the _Atlantic_ then just beginning\r\n",
      "under his editorship. My poem came back with the comment, \"Hardly good\r\n",
      "enough, but the writer certainly deserves encouragement.\" This frost,\r\n",
      "though not unkind, nipped my budding aspirations in that direction. I\r\n",
      "hung my modest harp on the willows and have almost never since twanged\r\n",
      "the strings. At a later time in England I came into pleasant relations\r\n",
      "with Lowell and saw his tender side. His term as Minister to England\r\n",
      "had come to a close. He had just lost his wife and was in deep\r\n",
      "affliction, the sorrow telling upon his health, but he took kind\r\n",
      "thought for me and helped me zealously in my quest of materials for\r\n",
      "a considerable historical work. He enable me to approach august\r\n",
      "personages whom otherwise I could not have reached; in particular\r\n",
      "securing for me a great courtesy from the Duke of Cleveland, a\r\n",
      "descendant of Vane, who gave me _carte blanche_ to visit Raby\r\n",
      "Castle in Durham, Vane's former home, a magnificent seat not usually\r\n",
      "open to visitors but which I saw thoroughly. I have already mentioned\r\n",
      "the funeral of Lowell. It took place on a lovely day in the August of\r\n",
      "1891. The procession passed from Appleton Chapel to Mount Auburn, and\r\n",
      "I, hurrying on reached the open grave before the line arrived. It was\r\n",
      "a spot of great beauty in a dell below the pleasant Indian Ridge on\r\n",
      "which just above lies the grave of Longfellow. At a few rods' distance\r\n",
      "is the sunny bank where later was laid to rest Oliver Wendell Holmes.\r\n",
      "Close at hand to the grave of Lowell lay his gifted wife, Maria\r\n",
      "White who wrote the lovely poem \"The Alpine Shepherd,\" and the three\r\n",
      "brilliant and intrepid nephews who were slain in the Civil War. The\r\n",
      "old horn-beams, quaint and unusual trees, stand sentry on either hand.\r\n",
      "I saw the coffin lowered. Standing just behind Phillips Brooks, I\r\n",
      "heard for the last time the voice of my boyhood friend reading with\r\n",

      "the home of Lowell. This spot he especially loved, he knew its trees,\r\n",
      "every one, and the birds and squirrels that came to visit them. I\r\n",
      "stood at the gate looking toward the old mansion aloof among the\r\n",
      "woods. I had often stood there and looked toward the house, but now\r\n",
      "it had a different aspect; usually its doors and windows were tightly\r\n",
      "closed, but now everything was wide open, the mourners had not\r\n",
      "returned to the house and at the moment no living being was visible.\r\n",
      "The windows and the portal looked out upon the late afternoon, in the\r\n",
      "dead silence; in the heightened feeling of the moment it seemed to me\r\n",
      "that the mansion had come to life, that it missed the fine spirit that\r\n",
      "had so lately flown forth from it, that with lids widely apart and\r\n",
      "distressful it looked forth into the great spacious heavens after a\r\n",
      "loved soul that had passed from it into the world beyond. It was only\r\n",

      "of Selbourne, and I myself feel that Lowell in some of his essays\r\n",
      "recording his study of the nature life at Elmwood equalled in fine\r\n",
      "insight, and surpassed in expression the observer at Concord. Then in\r\n",
      "these later years we have had John Muir and John Burroughs who cannot\r\n",
      "be set low, but among American writers Thoreau was the pioneer of\r\n",
      "nature-study. Audubon had preceded him but he worked mainly with the\r\n",
      "brush; to multitudes Thoreau opened the gate to the secrets of our\r\n",

      "sense, she by adoption and I through the fact that it had been the\r\n",
      "home of my forbears for seven generations. We were nearly of the\r\n",
      "same age and simultaneously made our first ventures into the world of\r\n",
      "letters, taking the same theme, the Civil War. One phase of this she\r\n",
      "portrayed in her _Hospital Sketches_, another, I in my _Colour\r\n",
      "Guard_. So we started in the race together but Louisa soon\r\n",
      "distanced me, emerging presently into matchless proficiency in her\r\n",
      "books for children. I sometimes saw her after she had become famous\r\n",
      "when she was attuning sweetly the hearts of multitudes of children\r\n",
      "with her fine humanity. She was a stately handsome woman with a most\r\n",
      "gracious and unobtrusive manner. She mingled with her neighbours, one\r\n",

      "lived within a few doors:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  It is so hard to think of Louisa as being a\r\n",
      "  distinguished personage; she sits down here with her\r\n",
      "  knitting or brings over her bread to be baked in\r\n",
      "  my oven as anybody might do, and chats about village\r\n",
      "  matters, as interested over the engagements of\r\n",

      "her vividly when she was well past youth, in the enjoyment of the\r\n",
      "substantial gains success had brought. In her childhood she had known\r\n",
      "pinching poverty, for her philosophic father could never exchange his\r\n",
      "lucubrations for bread and clothes, philosophising, however, none the\r\n",
      "less. But her success brought with it no flush, only an opportunity\r\n",
      "for her pleasant service. In these years my mood toward her had quite\r\n",
      "changed; at first I had thought of her as a competitor, perhaps as on\r\n",
      "my level. When I learned, however, that about that time she had been\r\n",
      "reading my _History of German Literature_ with approval, I felt\r\n",
      "that I was greatly honoured, that a mind of high distinction had\r\n",
      "condescended to notice my pages. During the '80s when the \"School\r\n",
      "of Philosophy\" was holding its sessions in the rustic temple on the\r\n",
      "Lexington Road where her Orphic father was hierophant, it was rumoured\r\n",
      "that Louisa looked somewhat askance upon the sublimated discussions\r\n",
      "of the brotherhood that gathered. What was said was very wise, but\r\n",
      "far removed from what one finds in children's books, but Louisa was\r\n",
      "sometimes present, a dignified hostess to the strangers who came,\r\n",
      "taking her modest part among the women in the entertainment of the\r\n",
      "guests but never in the conclave as a participant. Alas! that she went\r\n",

      "Hawthorne came into my consciousness when I was a boy of ten at school\r\n",
      "near the tall stone gate-posts immortalised by the great novelist\r\n",
      "as guarding the entrance to the Old Manse. The big gambrel-roofed\r\n",
      "building standing close to the Battle Ground as it stood on the 19th\r\n",
      "of April, 1775, was unpainted and weather-stained, the structure\r\n",
      "showing dark among the trees as one looked from the road. All the\r\n",
      "world knows it as described outside and in by its famous tenant. It\r\n",
      "is a shrine which may well evoke breathless interest. The ancient\r\n",
      "wainscoting, the ample low-studded rooms, the quaint fireplace, and at\r\n",
      "the rear toward the west the windows with their small panes on some\r\n",
      "of which Hawthorne made inscriptions. \"Every leaf and twig is outlined\r\n",
      "against the sky,\" or words to that effect, \"scratched with my wife's\r\n",
      "diamond ring\"; here the sunset pours in gorgeously but there is more\r\n",
      "of shadow than sunlight about the Old Manse, and that is befitting for\r\n",
      "a dwelling with associations somewhat sombre. In later years Hawthorne\r\n",
      "occupied a house on the Lexington Road, new and modern, writing there\r\n",
      "some famous books in an upper study said to be accessible only through\r\n",
      "a trap-door, but the Old Manse was the appropriate home for him. It\r\n",
      "was there that his young genius produced its earlier fruit and it\r\n",
      "deserves to be particularly cherished. As a little child I went once\r\n",
      "with my father and mother to Brook Farm in West Roxbury, at the time\r\n",
      "when the community was most interesting. The famous disciples of\r\n",
      "Fourier were then, I suppose, for the most part present, Margaret\r\n",
      "Fuller, Hawthorne, George Ripley, George William Curtis, Charles A.\r\n",
      "Dana and the rest, but I was too young to take note of them. I\r\n",
      "recall only George Ripley, the head of the enterprise, in a rough\r\n",
      "working-blouse who welcomed us at the gate. My father and he were old\r\n",
      "friends and as supper-time came and the community gathered singly and\r\n",
      "in groups in the dining-hall from the fields and groves outside, he\r\n",
      "said to my father: \"Your seat at the table will be next to Hawthorne,\r\n",
      "but I shall not introduce you, Mr. Hawthorne prefers not to be\r\n",
      "introduced to people.\" It was a cropping out of the strange aloofness\r\n",
      "for which Hawthorne was marked. He could do his part in the day's\r\n",
      "work, be a man among men, dicker with the importers at the Salem\r\n",
      "Custom House and as Consul at Liverpool, rub effectively with the\r\n",
      "traders, but his choice was always for solitude, he liked to go for\r\n",
      "days without speaking to a human being and to live withdrawn from the\r\n",
      "contacts of the world, even from his neighbours and family. Probably\r\n",
      "it was because he was so thoroughly a recluse that I recall seeing\r\n",
      "Hawthorne only once, although he was in the village in whose streets\r\n",
      "I was constantly passing. Driving one day on the road near his home a\r\n",
      "companion exclaimed, \"There goes Mr. Hawthorne on the sidewalk!\" I\r\n",
      "put my head forward quickly to get a glimpse from the cover of the\r\n",
      "carriage of so famous a personage, and at the roadside was a fine,\r\n",
      "tall, athletic person with handsome features. My quick movement\r\n",
      "forward in the carriage he took for a bow and he returned it raising\r\n",
      "his hat with gentlemanly courtesy, it was all through a mistake that\r\n",
      "I got this bow from Hawthorne but all the same I treasure it. A\r\n",
      "sister-in-law of his, who was often an inmate of his home, told me\r\n",
      "that Hawthorne really believed in ghosts. It will be remembered that\r\n",
      "in the introduction to the _Mosses from an Old Manse_, Hawthorne\r\n",
      "speaks of the spectre of an ancient minister who haunted it, the\r\n",
      "rustling of his silken gown was sometimes heard in the hallways. My\r\n",
      "friend attributed this passage to something which happened during one\r\n",
      "of her visits. She sat one evening with her sister and Hawthorne in\r\n",
      "the low-studded living-room, and, as was often the case, in silence.\r\n",
      "She thought she heard in the entry the rustling of silk, it might\r\n",
      "have been a whistling of the wind or the swaying of a drapery, but\r\n",
      "it seemed to her like the sweeping along of a train of silk. At the\r\n",
      "moment she thought that Mrs. Hawthorne was passing through the entry,\r\n",
      "but rousing herself from her abstraction she saw her sister sitting\r\n",
      "quiet and remembered that she had been so sitting for a considerable\r\n",
      "interval. \"Why, I distinctly heard,\" said she, \"the rustling of a silk\r\n",
      "gown in the entry!\" The sisters rose and went into the hallway for an\r\n",
      "explanation, but all was dark and still, no draperies were stirring,\r\n",
      "no wind whistled, and they returned to their chairs, talking for a\r\n",
      "moment over the mysterious sound, then relapsing into their former\r\n",
      "quiet. Hawthorne meantime sat dreaming, apparently not noticing the\r\n",
      "light ripple in the quiet of the evening; but not long after--when my\r\n",
      "friend read the _Mosses from an Old Manse_, she found that the\r\n",
      "incident had made an impression upon him and that he interpreted the\r\n",
      "sound as a ghostly happening. She told me another story which she said\r\n",
      "she had directly from Hawthorne. During a sojourn in Boston he\r\n",
      "often went to the reading-room of the Athenaeum and was particularly\r\n",
      "interested to see a certain newspaper. This paper he often found in\r\n",
      "the hands of an old man and he was sometimes annoyed because the old\r\n",
      "man retained it so long. The old man lived in a suburb and for some\r\n",
      "reason was equally interested with himself in that paper. This went on\r\n",
      "for weeks until one day Hawthorne, entering the room, found the paper\r\n",
      "as usual in the hands of this man. Hawthorne sat down and waited\r\n",
      "patiently as often before until the old man had finished. After a time\r\n",
      "the man rose, put on his hat and overcoat, and took his departure. As\r\n",
      "the door of the reading-room closed behind him Hawthorne took up\r\n",
      "the paper which lay in disorder as the man had left it, when, lo and\r\n",
      "behold, his eye fell in the first column on a notice of the old man's\r\n",
      "death. He was at the moment lying dead in his house in the suburbs and\r\n",
      "yet Hawthorne had beheld him but a moment before in his usual guise\r\n",
      "reading the paper in the Athenaeum! My friend said that Hawthorne told\r\n",
      "her the story quietly without attempt at explanation and she believed\r\n",
      "his thought was that he had actually seen a ghost. The readers of\r\n",
      "Hawthorne will recall passages which are consonant with the idea that\r\n",
      "Hawthorne believed in ghosts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No other author has affected me quite so profoundly as did Hawthorne.\r\n",
      "The period of my development from childhood through youth to maturity\r\n",
      "was coeval with the time of his literary activities. The first vivid\r\n",
      "impression I received from books came from his stories for\r\n",
      "children, _Grandfather's Chair_, _Famous Old People_, and _The\r\n",
      "Liberty Tree_; when somewhat older I read _The Rill from the Town\r\n",
      "Pump_ and _Little Annie's Ramble_, still later came the weird\r\n",
      "creations in which Hawthorne's expanding genius manifested\r\n",
      "itself, such as _The Minister's Black Veil_, _Rappaccini's\r\n",
      "Daughter_, and _The Celestial Railroad_. And not less in young\r\n",
      "manhood I was awed and absorbed in the great works of his maturity,\r\n",
      "_The Scarlet Letter_, _The Blithedale Romance_, _The House\r\n",
      "of the Seven Gables_, and the _Marble Faun._ Meat and drink as\r\n",
      "they were to me in my youth and first entrance into life, I naturally\r\n",
      "feel that the author of these books was in mind profoundly powerful.\r\n",
      "In point of genius among our Americans I should set no man before him.\r\n",
      "He was not a moral inspirer nor a leader, he gave to no one directly\r\n",
      "any spiritual uplift, nor did he help one directly to strength in\r\n",
      "fighting the battles of life. He was a peerless artist portraying\r\n",
      "marvellously the secret things of the human soul, his concrete\r\n",
      "pictures taken from the old Puritan society, from the New England of\r\n",
      "his day and from the passionate Italian life. He portrays but he draws\r\n",
      "no lesson any more than Shakespeare, his books are pictures of the\r\n",
      "souls of men, of the sweet and wholesome things and also the weakness,\r\n",
      "the sin and the morbid defect. These having been revealed the reader\r\n",
      "is left to his own inferences. It is fully made plain that he was\r\n",
      "a soft-hearted man, at any rate in his earlier time. The stories\r\n",
      "he wrote at the outset for children are often full of sweetness and\r\n",
      "sympathy. But as he went on with his work these qualities are less\r\n",
      "apparent, the spirit of the artist more and more prevailing, until he\r\n",
      "paints with relentless realism even what is hideous, not approving or\r\n",
      "condemning; it is part of life and must be set down. Many have thought\r\n",
      "it strange that Hawthorne apparently had no patriotism. In our Civil\r\n",
      "War he stood quite indifferent, a marked contrast with the men among\r\n",
      "whom he lived and who like him have literary eminence. These passages\r\n",
      "stand in his diary and letters. \"February 14, 1862, Frank Pierce came\r\n",
      "here to-night.... He is bigoted as to the Union and sees nothing\r\n",
      "but ruin without it. Whereas I should not much regret an ultimate\r\n",
      "separation.\" \"At present we have no country.... New England is really\r\n",
      "quite as large a lump of earth as my heart can take in. I have no\r\n",
      "kindred with or leaning toward the abolitionists.\" But his coolness to\r\n",
      "his country's welfare was of a piece with the general coolness toward\r\n",
      "well and ill in the affairs of the world. Humanity rolls before him\r\n",
      "as it did before Shakespeare, sometimes weak, sometimes heroic,\r\n",
      "depressed, exultant, suffering, happy. He did not concern himself to\r\n",
      "regulate its movement, to heighten its joy, or mitigate its sorrow.\r\n",
      "His work was to portray it as it moved, and in that conception of\r\n",
      "his mission he established his masterfulness as an artist, though it\r\n",
      "abates somewhat, does it not? from his wholeness as a man.\r\n",

      "Some years ago in introducing Dr. Edward Waldo Emerson to an audience\r\n",
      "in St. Louis, I said that our great-grandfathers had stood together\r\n",
      "with the Minute Men of Concord at the North Bridge on the 19th of\r\n",
      "April, 1775. His ancestor as their minister inspiring them with the\r\n",
      "idea of freedom, my ancestor as an officer, who by word and deed kept\r\n",
      "the farmers firm before the British volleys. The old-time connection\r\n",
      "between the two families persisted. Ralph Waldo Emerson and my father\r\n",
      "were contemporaries coming through the Harvard gate into the small\r\n",
      "company of Unitarian ministers at about the same period and somewhat\r\n",
      "associated in their young manhood. Mrs. Emerson had been Lydia Jackson\r\n",
      "of Plymouth, baptised, into the old Pilgrim Parish by the father of my\r\n",
      "mother. Lydia Jackson and my mother had been girls together, and good\r\n",
      "friends. It was natural, therefore, that, with these antecedents when\r\n",
      "I as a young boy arrived in Concord, I should come into touch with the\r\n",
      "Emersons. They were indeed pleasant friends to me, both Mr. and Mrs.\r\n",

      "and a keen, firm face. In his glance was complete kindliness and also\r\n",
      "profound penetration. His nose was markedly expressive, sharp, and\r\n",
      "well to the fore. In his lips there was geniality as well as firmness.\r\n",
      "His smooth hair concealed a head and brow not large but well rounded.\r\n",
      "His face was always without beard. Though slight, he was vigorous and\r\n",
      "the erect figure striding at a rapid pace could be encountered any day\r\n",
      "in all weathers, not only on the streets but in the fields and woods.\r\n",
      "Unlike his neighbour Hawthorne his instincts were always social. He\r\n",
      "mingled affably with low and high and I have never heard a more hearty\r\n",
      "tribute to him than came from an Irish washwoman, his neighbour, who\r\n",
      "only knew him as he chatted with her over the fence about the round of\r\n",
      "affairs that interested her. He always had a smile and a pleasant word\r\n",
      "for the school-children and at town-meeting bore his part among the\r\n",
      "farmers in discussing the affairs of the community. His voice in\r\n",
      "particular bespoke the man. It had a rich resonance and a subtle\r\n",
      "quality that gave to the most cursory listener an impression of\r\n",
      "culture. His speech was deliberate, sometimes hesitating, and his\r\n",
      "phrases often, even when he talked on simple themes, had especial\r\n",
      "point and appropriateness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a child I recall him among groups of children in his garden a\r\n",
      "little aloof but beaming with a happy smile. At a later time, when\r\n",
      "I was in college, we used sometimes to walk the twenty miles from\r\n",
      "Cambridge to Concord and the student group always found in him a\r\n",
      "hospitable entertainer. By that time he had reached the height of his\r\n",
      "fame. Those of us who sought him had been readers of _Nature_ or\r\n",
      "the poems, of _Representative Men_, and of _English Traits_.\r\n",
      "For my own part while I did not always understand his thought, much\r\n",
      "of it was entering into my very fibre. In particular the essays on\r\n",
      "self-reliance and idealism were moulding my life. We approached him\r\n",
      "with some awe, \"If he asks me where I live,\" said one of our number,\r\n",
      "a boy who was slain in the Civil War, \"I shall tell him I can be\r\n",
      "found at No. So-and-so of such an alley, but if you mean to predicate\r\n",
      "concerning the spiritual entity, I dwell in the temple of the infinite\r\n",
      "and I breathe the breath of truth.\" But when Emerson met us at the\r\n",
      "gate, things were not at all on a high transcendental plane. There was\r\n",
      "a hearty \"Good-morning,\" significant from him as he stood among the\r\n",
      "syringas, and there were sandwiches and strawberries in profusion, a\r\n",
      "plain bread-and-butter atmosphere very pleasant to us after a long and\r\n",
      "dusty tramp. On one occasion Emerson withdrew into the background, we\r\n",
      "thought too much, while he gave the front place in the library, after\r\n",
      "he had superintended royally the satisfaction of our bodily needs, to\r\n",
      "his neighbour Bronson Alcott. Mr. Alcott white-haired and oracular,\r\n",
      "talked to us about Shakespeare. There was probably a secondary sense\r\n",
      "in every line of Shakespeare which would become apparent to all such\r\n",
      "as attained the necessary fineness of soul. Perhaps we should find in\r\n",
      "this the gospel of a new Covenant in which Shakespeare would be the\r\n",
      "great teacher and leader. Mysteries were gathering about him, who was\r\n",
      "he? Who really wrote his plays and poems? The adumbrations of a new\r\n",
      "supernatural figure were looming in the conception of the world.\r\n",
      "Mr. Alcott mused through the afternoon in characteristic fashion and\r\n",
      "Emerson sat with us, silently absorbing the mystic speculation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mr. Emerson was not always silent. A good friend of his who was\r\n",
      "akin to me and over partial, invited him to her house with a little\r\n",
      "circle of neighbours and lo, I was to furnish the entertainment! I had\r\n",
      "written a college poem and with some sinking of heart I learned that I\r\n",
      "was to read it to this company of which Emerson was to be a member.\r\n",
      "I faced the music and for half an hour rolled off my stanzas. At the\r\n",
      "close, my kinswoman arranged that I should talk with Emerson in a\r\n",
      "corner by ourselves and for another half-hour he talked to me. I am\r\n",
      "bound to say that he said little about my poem, but devoted himself\r\n",
      "almost entirely to an enthusiastic outpouring over Walt Whitman's\r\n",
      "_Leaves of Grass_, an advance copy of which had just been sent\r\n",
      "him. A stronger commendation of a piece of literary work than he gave\r\n",
      "it would be hard to conceive. He had been moved by it to the depths\r\n",
      "and his forecast for its author was a fame of the brightest. It was\r\n",
      "then I first heard of Walt Whitman. Soon after the world heard much\r\n",
      "of him and it still hears much of him. Emerson did not confine the\r\n",
      "expression of his admiration of Walt Whitman to me, as the world\r\n",
      "knows; he expressed it with an equal outspokenness to the poet, who\r\n",
      "curiously enough thought it proper to print it in gilt letters on the\r\n",
      "cover of his book, \"I greet you at the beginning of a great career.\"\r\n",
      "To do that was certainly a violation of literary comity, but who shall\r\n",
      "give laws to rough-riding genius! It is a penalty of eminence to be\r\n",
      "made sponsor unwittingly before the public for men and things when\r\n",
      "reticence would seem better. At any rate it brought Whitman well into\r\n",
      "notice and I have never heard, rough diamond though he undoubtedly\r\n",
      "was, that Walt Whitman's withers were wrung by this breach of\r\n",
      "confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is a little nook by Gore Hall in Cambridge with which I have\r\n",
      "a queer medley of associations. One night I was tossed in a blanket\r\n",
      "there during my initiation into the Hasty Pudding Club. Precisely\r\n",
      "there I met Emerson rather memorably on the Commemoration Day in 1865\r\n",
      "when he said to me, glancing at my soldier's uniform, in very simple\r\n",
      "words but with an intonation that betrayed deep feeling, \"This day\r\n",
      "belongs to you.\" Immediately after, hard by I shook hands with Meade,\r\n",
      "the towering stately victor of Gettysburg in the full uniform of a\r\n",
      "corps commander, in contrast indeed to the slight, plainly-dressed\r\n",
      "philosopher. And only the other day I helped my little granddaughter\r\n",
      "to feed the grey squirrels in the same green nook from which the\r\n",
      "rollicking boys, the sage, and the warrior have so long since\r\n",
      "vanished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have heard it remarked by a man of much literary discrimination that\r\n",
      "Emerson's poetic gift was pre-eminent and that he should have made\r\n",
      "verse and not prose his principal medium for expression. As it is his\r\n",
      "poems are few, his habitual medium being prose. The critic attributed\r\n",
      "this to a distrust which Emerson felt of his power of dealing with\r\n",
      "poetic form, the harmonious arrangement of lines. He felt that Emerson\r\n",
      "was right in his judgment of himself, that there was a defect here,\r\n",
      "and that it was well for him to choose as he did. All this I hesitate\r\n",
      "to accept. As regards form, while the verse of Emerson certainly is\r\n",
      "sometimes rough, few things in poetry are more exquisite than many\r\n",
      "verses which all will recall. What stanzas ever flowed more sweetly\r\n",
      "than these written for the dedication of the Concord monument? \"By\r\n",
      "the rude bridge that arched the flood,\" or the little poem on the\r\n",
      "snow-storm, \"Announced by all the trumpets of the sky arrives the\r\n",
      "snow.\" _The Boston Hymn_, too, though in parts informal to the\r\n",
      "point of carelessness, has passages of the finest music,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  \"The rocky nook with hill-tops three,\r\n",
      "  Looked eastward from the farms\r\n",
      "  And twice each day the flowing sea\r\n",
      "  Took Boston in its arms.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Emerson when he gave his mind to it could sing as harmoniously as the\r\n",
      "best. Possibly we ought to regret that he did not write for the most\r\n",
      "part in verse. It is verse which comes and clings most closely to our\r\n",
      "souls and which memory holds most permanently. Prose is the inferior\r\n",
      "medium when a great utterance is addressed to men, it is the singer\r\n",
      "pre-eminently who holds our hearts and lives forever. But Emerson\r\n",
      "chose to be what he was and we are thankful for him. Many were vexed\r\n",
      "with Matthew Arnold whom we thought depreciatory, but I find no fault\r\n",
      "with his summing up of Emerson, \"as the friend of all those who seek\r\n",
      "to live in the spirit.\" His prose and poetry are a precious possession\r\n",
      "and we should be grateful for both, and for him. But my purpose here\r\n",
      "as always is not to criticise but only to touch the light outside\r\n",
      "things, pausing at the edge of profundities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I knew Emerson when I was a child and I also knew him when I was well\r\n",
      "advanced in years at a time when, of course, he was close upon his\r\n",
      "end. His old age was pathetic. As often happens his memory failed\r\n",
      "while his other faculties were strong and the embarrassment of the\r\n",
      "thinker aroused sadness in those who came near him as the trusty\r\n",
      "servant fell short, though the mind in general was active. Emerson\r\n",
      "felt that I had put him under some obligation by giving him the\r\n",
      "first portrait he had ever seen of his faithful German disciple and\r\n",
      "translator Hermann Grimm. Perhaps that helped the welcome with which I\r\n",
      "was received when I went to see him not far from the end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had as a fellow-guest a man who had long been intimate with him and\r\n",
      "whom he was very glad to see; talking after tea in the library Emerson\r\n",
      "said, \"I want to tell you about a friend in Germany, his name I cannot\r\n",
      "remember,\" and he moved to and fro uneasily, in his effort to recall\r\n",
      "it. \"This friend with whom we have taken tea to-night, whose name also\r\n",
      "I cannot remember,\" here again came a distressed look at the failure\r\n",
      "of his faculty, \"I cannot remember his name either, but he can tell\r\n",
      "you of this German friend whose name I have also forgotten.\" It was a\r\n",
      "sorrow to see the breaking down of a great spirit and his agitation as\r\n",
      "he was conscious of his waning power. And yet so far as I could see,\r\n",
      "it was only the memory that was going; the intellectual strength was\r\n",
      "still apparent and the amiability of his spirit was perhaps even\r\n",
      "more manifest than in the years when he was in the full possession of\r\n",
      "himself. This came out in little things; he was over-anxious at the\r\n",
      "table lest the hospitality should come short, troubled about the\r\n",
      "supply of butter and apple-sauce, and soon after I saw him on his\r\n",
      "knees on the hearth taking care that the fire should catch the wood to\r\n",
      "abate the evening coolness that was gathering in the room. At the same\r\n",
      "time his mood was playful. Mrs. Emerson sat at hand, a woman in her\r\n",
      "old age of striking beauty, with her silver hair beneath a cap of\r\n",
      "lace, her violet eyes, and her white face. Miss Ellen Emerson, too,\r\n",
      "was present, shielding her father in his decline like a guardian\r\n",
      "angel. Mrs. Emerson spoke with pleasure of her old life at Plymouth.\r\n",
      "\"Ah, Plymouth,\" broke in Emerson, \"that town of towns. We shall never\r\n",
      "hear the last of Plymouth!\" And so he rallied his wife merrily over\r\n",
      "her patriotic love for her birthplace. The time was coming for him\r\n",
      "to go and he went serenely, the vital cord softly and gradually\r\n",
      "disengaged. In Sleepy Hollow lie near each other the four memorable\r\n",
      "graves, Hawthorne's, Thoreau's, Louisa Alcott's, and Emerson's. I know\r\n",
      "the spot well, on the ridge which slopes up from the lower ground,\r\n",
      "for there my own kin lie buried. Upon the same ridge rise the tall\r\n",
      "oracular pines and there is always a sweet murmur which the feeling\r\n",
      "heart understands as a sub-conscious requiem breathed by the \"Nature\"\r\n",
      "of which these fine spirits were the interpreters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A day or two after entering college I made one of a group of freshmen,\r\n",
      "who, as the dusk fell, were working off their surplus energy by\r\n",
      "jumping over the posts along the curbstone of a quiet street. One of\r\n",
      "our number had an unfair advantage, his length of leg being so great\r\n",
      "that as he bestrode the post, he scarcely needed to take his feet from\r\n",
      "the ground, while for the rest of us a good hop was necessary fairly\r\n",
      "to clear the top. That is my earliest memory of Phillips Brooks. Big\r\n",
      "as he was, he was a year, perhaps two years, younger than most of us,\r\n",
      "and had the boyishness proper to his immaturity. He had come from his\r\n",
      "long training in the Boston Latin School, was reputed, like the rest\r\n",
      "of his class, to be able to repeat the Latin and Greek grammars from\r\n",
      "beginning to end, exceptions, examples, and all, and to have at his\r\n",
      "tongue's end other acquirements equally wonderful in the eyes of us\r\n",
      "boys who in our distant Western homes had had a smaller chance. He was\r\n",
      "an excellent scholar without needing to apply himself, and perhaps\r\n",
      "had more distinction in the student societies than in the class-room.\r\n",
      "Socially he was good-natured and playful, never aggressive, too modest\r\n",
      "to be a leader, rather reticent. It was with surprise that I heard\r\n",
      "Brooks for the first time in a college society. The quiet fellow of a\r\n",
      "sudden poured out a torrent of words and, young though I was, I\r\n",
      "felt that they were not empty. There was plenty of thought and\r\n",
      "well-arranged knowledge. This pregnant fluency always characterised\r\n",
      "his public deliverances. Of late years it has been reported that\r\n",
      "he had at first a defect of speech, and to this the extraordinary\r\n",
      "momentum of his utterance was due. In the early time I never heard of\r\n",
      "this. He did not stammer, nor was there other impediment; only this\r\n",
      "preternaturally rapid outpouring on occasion, from a man usually\r\n",
      "quiet. When I heard him preach in later years the peculiarity\r\n",
      "remained. It was the Phillips Brooks of the Institute of 1770,\r\n",
      "matured, however, into noble spiritual power.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brooks had attained nearly or quite his full height on entering\r\n",
      "college, nor was he slender. His large frame was too loosely knit\r\n",
      "to admit of his becoming an athlete. He had no interest in outdoor\r\n",
      "sports. I do not recall that he was warmly diligent in study or\r\n",
      "general reading. His mind worked quickly and easily. Without effort he\r\n",
      "stood well in the class, absorbing whatever other knowledge he touched\r\n",
      "without much searching. His countenance and head in boyhood were\r\n",
      "noticeably fine, the forehead broad and full, the beardless face\r\n",
      "lighting up readily with an engaging smile, the eyes large and\r\n",
      "lustrous. It was evident that a good and able man must come out from\r\n",
      "the boy Phillips Brooks, but no one, not even President Walker, who\r\n",
      "was credited with an almost uncanny penetration in divining the\r\n",
      "future of his boys, would have predicted the career of Brooks. Though\r\n",
      "decorous and high-minded he was not marked as a religious man. If he\r\n",
      "were so, he kept it to himself. Though sometimes hilarious, he was\r\n",
      "never ungentle or inconsiderate, a wholesome, happy youth, having due\r\n",
      "thought for others and for his own walk and conversation, but without\r\n",
      "touch of formal piety. When I was initiated into the Hasty Pudding\r\n",
      "Club, I recognised in a tall fiend whose trouser legs were very\r\n",
      "apparent beneath the too scanty black drapery which enveloped him, no\r\n",
      "other than Phillips Brooks. He was one of the most vociferous of\r\n",
      "the imps who tossed me in the blanket, and later, when the elaborate\r\n",
      "manuscript I had prepared was brought forth, was conspicuously\r\n",
      "energetic in daubing with hot mush from a huge wooden spoon the sheets\r\n",
      "I had composed with much painstaking. The grand event in the \"Pudding\"\r\n",
      "of our time was the performance of Fielding's extravaganza of _Tom\r\n",
      "Thumb_. I think it was the club's first attempt at an operatic\r\n",
      "performance, and it was prepared with great care. I suppose I am\r\n",
      "to-day the only survivor among those who took part, and it is a sombre\r\n",
      "pleasure to recall the old-time frolic. The great promoter of the\r\n",
      "undertaking was Theodore Lyman, able and forceful afterward as\r\n",
      "soldier, scientist, and congressman, who died prematurely; but the\r\n",
      "music and details were arranged by Joseph C. Heywood, later a devout\r\n",
      "Catholic, ending his career in Rome as Chamberlain of Pope Leo XIII.\r\n",
      "In the cast Heywood was King Arthur and Lyman, general of the army.\r\n",
      "There were besides, a throng of warriors, lords, and ladies wonderful\r\n",
      "to behold. The costumes were elaborate. Old trunks and attics of our\r\n",
      "friends were ransacked for ancient finery and appointments that might\r\n",
      "be made to serve. Provision was made for thrilling stage effects,\r\n",
      "chief among them a marvellous cow which at a critical moment swallowed\r\n",
      "Tom Thumb, and then with much eructation worked out painfully on the\r\n",
      "bass-viol, belched him forth as if discharged from a catapult. The\r\n",
      "music was an adaptation of popular airs, operatic and otherwise, to\r\n",
      "the words of Fielding, and was fairly good, rendered as it was by\r\n",
      "fresh young voices and an orchestra whose members played in the\r\n",
      "Pierian Sodality. The merriment of the lines was more robust than\r\n",
      "delicate, but with some pruning it passed. The bill of announcement,\r\n",
      "which was hung up in the Pudding room, and which possibly is still\r\n",
      "preserved, was very elaborately and handsomely designed, and I think\r\n",
      "was the work of Alexander Agassiz, who had much skill of that kind.\r\n",
      "The performers were all strenuous and some capable, but the hit of the\r\n",
      "evening was Phillips Brooks, who personated the giantess Glumdalca to\r\n",
      "perfection. He was then nineteen, and had reached his full stature.\r\n",
      "He was attired in flowing skirts and befitting bodice, and wore a\r\n",
      "towering head-dress of feather dusters or something similar, which\r\n",
      "swept the ceiling as he strode. I had been cast originally for the\r\n",
      "Queen, but it was afterwards judged that I had special qualifications\r\n",
      "for the part of Princess. Like the youths in Comus, my unrazored lips\r\n",
      "in those days were as smooth as Hebe's, and I had a slenderness that\r\n",
      "was quite in keeping. Dressed in an old brocade gown, an heirloom from\r\n",
      "the century before, with a lofty white wig, and proper patches upon my\r\n",
      "pink cheeks, I essayed the rôle of _une belle dame sans merci_.\r\n",
      "Brooks and I were rivals for the affection of Tom Thumb, and I do not\r\n",
      "recall which succeeded. The tragedy was most extreme. In the closing\r\n",
      "scene the entire cast underwent destruction, strewing the stage with\r\n",
      "a picturesque heap of slain. We were not so very dead, for the victims\r\n",
      "near the foot-lights in order to give the curtain room to fall,\r\n",
      "drew up their legs or rolled out of the way, in a spirit of polite\r\n",
      "accommodation. The most impressive part of the spectacle was the\r\n",
      "defunct giantess, whose wide-spreading draperies and head-gear, as\r\n",
      "Brooks came down with a well-studied crash, took up so much of the\r\n",
      "floor that the rest of us had no room left to die in dignity. The\r\n",
      "piece was so much of a success that we performed it again at the house\r\n",
      "of Theodore Lyman, in Brookline,--and still again, at Chickering Hall\r\n",
      "in Boston.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though Brooks could frolic upon occasion, his mood in his student days\r\n",
      "was prevailingly grave, and as he matured, warmed, and deepened into\r\n",
      "earnest religious conviction. My own close association with him came\r\n",
      "to an end at our graduation. Our respective fates led us in fields\r\n",
      "widely apart, and we met only at rare intervals. Ten years after\r\n",
      "graduation we came together in a way for me memorable. He was\r\n",
      "already held in the affectionate reverence of multitudes, and perhaps\r\n",
      "established in the position in which he so long stood as the most\r\n",
      "moving and venerated of American preachers. At the commemoration for\r\n",
      "the Harvard soldiers, in 1865, he was the chaplain, and his prayer\r\n",
      "shares with the _Commemoration Ode_ of Lowell the admiration of\r\n",
      "men as an utterance especially uplifting. My humble function on\r\n",
      "that day was to speak for the rank and file, and Brooks and I, as\r\n",
      "classmates, sat elbow to elbow at the table under the great tent. He\r\n",
      "was charmingly genial and brotherly. His old playfulness came out as\r\n",
      "he rallied me on the deterioration he noticed in my table manners, due\r\n",
      "no doubt to my life in camp, and rebuked me with mock sternness\r\n",
      "for appropriating his portion of our common chicken. With evident\r\n",
      "pleasure, he drew out of his pocket the _Nation_, then just\r\n",
      "beginning, and showed me a kind notice of my _Thinking Bayonet_,\r\n",
      "written by Charles Eliot Norton. But behind the smile and the joke\r\n",
      "lay a new dignity and earnestness, a quality he had taken on since the\r\n",
      "days of our old comradeship. So it always was as we met transiently\r\n",
      "while the decades passed until the threshold of old age lay across\r\n",
      "the path for both of us. Now and then I had from him an affectionate\r\n",
      "letter. One of these I found profoundly touching. Theodore Lyman lay\r\n",
      "prostrate with a lingering and painful illness from which he never\r\n",
      "rose. Brooks wrote that he had carried to him my _Life of Young Sir\r\n",
      "Henry Vane_, and read from it to our dying friend. My story had\r\n",
      "interest for them, and I felt that whatever might befall my book I had\r\n",
      "not worked in vain if two such men found it worthy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phillips Brooks early had recognition as the most important religious\r\n",
      "influence of his time, and his spirit was not less broad-minded\r\n",
      "than it was fervent. In the multitudes that felt the power of his\r\n",
      "impassioned address were included men and women of the most various\r\n",
      "views, and he quickened the life of the spirit in all households of\r\n",
      "faith. His sympathies were most catholic, and this anecdote clearly\r\n",
      "illuminates his broad-mindedness. I had dropped into a Boston\r\n",
      "bookstore on a quiet morning; Brooks presently came in to browse over\r\n",
      "the new issues on the counters. There was no one to disturb us, as we\r\n",
      "enjoyed this our last conversation together. He spoke of Channing. \"Do\r\n",
      "you know,\" said he, \"when Dean Stanley came over here I went to East\r\n",
      "Boston to see him on his ship. He said to me almost at once, 'Where\r\n",
      "is Mount Auburn?' Why, said I, how strange that the first thing you\r\n",
      "inquire about as you arrive is a cemetery! 'But is not Channing buried\r\n",
      "there?' said he. I told him I did not know. 'Well, he is and I want\r\n",
      "to go at once to the grave of Channing!' So as soon as we could,\"\r\n",
      "continued Phillips Brooks, \"we took a carriage and drove to Mount\r\n",
      "Auburn to visit the grave of Channing.\" He sympathised fully with\r\n",
      "the admiration felt by his friend, the great English churchman,\r\n",
      "for Channing, and gladly did him homage, and his talk flowed on in\r\n",
      "channels that showed his heart was warm toward men of all creeds who\r\n",
      "were inspired by the higher life. This noble candour of mind was a\r\n",
      "marked element of his power, and has endeared his memory among scores\r\n",
      "of sects that too often clash. How sweetly unifying in the midst of a\r\n",
      "jarring Christendom has been the spirit of Phillips Brooks!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After this I saw him only once. It was at the funeral of James Russell\r\n",
      "Lowell. In Appleton Chapel he stood in his robes, gentle and powerful,\r\n",
      "as he read the burial service. When the body was committed to the\r\n",
      "grave I stood just behind him and heard his voice in the last hallowed\r\n",
      "sentences, \"Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, and the spirit to the God\r\n",
      "who gave it.\" I never heard that voice again.\r\n",

      "MEN OF SCIENCE\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In England, in the fall of 1870, I missed an opportunity to see the\r\n",
      "great scientific men of the time. Faraday was still active, and in the\r\n",
      "full ripeness of his fame. Huxley, Tyndall, Darwin, Sir Joseph Hooker,\r\n",
      "Joule, Lyell, Murchison were in the midst of their best work, and\r\n",
      "probably all or most of them were present at the meeting of the\r\n",
      "British Association, which took place that year somewhere in the west\r\n",
      "of England. Miss Frances Power Cobbe, with whom I had for some time\r\n",
      "maintained a correspondence, growing out of the interest I felt in her\r\n",
      "_Intuitive Morals_, and other writings, invited me to accompany\r\n",
      "her to the meeting, at which, introduced by her, I might have had\r\n",
      "interesting interviews. I let the chance go by, and feel to-day that\r\n",
      "my memory stands impoverished in that it holds no first-hand knowledge\r\n",
      "of the lights, who in their century were the glory of their country\r\n",
      "and the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Germany I was more fortunate. Arriving at Heidelberg at a time\r\n",
      "before its high prestige had suffered much diminution, I found in all\r\n",
      "the four Faculties men of great distinction. One hears that in the\r\n",
      "stern centralising to which since 1870 Germany has been subjected the\r\n",
      "outer universities have suffered, their strength, their able teachers,\r\n",
      "namely, being drawn away for a brilliant concentration at Berlin.\r\n",
      "In the little university town of those days students and professors\r\n",
      "rubbed closely and great men were sometimes found in odd environments.\r\n",
      "Expressing once a desire to see a certain venerable theologian of wide\r\n",
      "fame, I was told he was sure to be found on such and such evenings\r\n",
      "in a well-known _bier locale_, and there I had opportunity to\r\n",
      "observe him, an aged and withered figure, with a proper stein of\r\n",
      "the amber fluid frothing at his side, and a halo from an active pipe\r\n",
      "enwreathing his grey hair, as he joked and gossiped familiarly with\r\n",
      "his fellow-loiterers about the heavy oak table. At another time I was\r\n",
      "among surroundings less rough, the guest-room of a club of the finer\r\n",
      "world, curtained and carpeted, and made attractive with pictures,\r\n",
      "flowers, and music. A company of ladies and gentlemen sat sipping\r\n",
      "_Maiwein_ and _Mark gräfler_, while a conjurer entertained\r\n",
      "them with his tricks. During one of these, desiring a confederate from\r\n",
      "the lookers-on, he approached a slender and refined-looking man, who\r\n",
      "was following the necromancer's proceedings with as much interest as\r\n",
      "anybody. The wizard's air of deference, and the respectful looks of\r\n",
      "the company led me to infer that he was a man above the common, but\r\n",
      "he took part affably in what was going on, helped out the trick, and\r\n",
      "laughed and wondered with the rest when it succeeded. I presently\r\n",
      "learned to my surprise and amusement that the amiable confederate of\r\n",
      "the conjurer was no other than the physicist Kirchoff, then in\r\n",
      "fresh and brilliant fame as the inventor of the spectroscope and the\r\n",
      "initiator of the scientific method known as spectrolysis. The fact has\r\n",
      "long been known that a prism properly contrived will decompose a\r\n",
      "ray of white light into the seven primary colours, but the broad and\r\n",
      "narrow bands running across the variegated scheme of the spectrum had\r\n",
      "either escaped notice or been neglected as phenomena not significant.\r\n",
      "Now came, however, my genial fellow-guest of the Heidelberg Club,\r\n",
      "detecting that the lines of the spectrum were one thing or another\r\n",
      "according to the substance emitting the light, and forthwith the world\r\n",
      "became aware of a discovery of vast moment. The light of the sun,\r\n",
      "and of the stars more distant than the sun, could be analysed or\r\n",
      "spectrolised, and a certain knowledge was shed of what was burning\r\n",
      "there in the immensely distant spaces. We can know what constitutes\r\n",
      "a star as unerringly as we know the constituents of the earth. Still\r\n",
      "more, among the supposed elements to which painstaking chemists had\r\n",
      "reduced composite matter, many were found by the all-discerning prism\r\n",
      "to be not ultimate, but themselves susceptible of subtler division.\r\n",
      "In fact here was a method of chemical and physical analysis, much more\r\n",
      "powerful, and also more delicate, than had before been known, and\r\n",
      "the idea of the scientists as to the make-up of the material universe\r\n",
      "deepened and widened wondrously. I sat often among the crowd of\r\n",
      "students in Kirchoff's lecture-room, watching the play of his delicate\r\n",
      "features as he unravelled mysteries which till he showed the way were\r\n",
      "a mere hopeless knot. Near him as he spoke, on a table were the wand,\r\n",
      "the rings, the vials, above all a spectroscope with its prisms, the\r\n",
      "apparatus with which the magician solved the universe. Once, as I\r\n",
      "stood near him, he indicated in a polite sentence, with a gesture\r\n",
      "toward the table, that I was free to use these appliances. In the\r\n",
      "depth of my unknowledge I felt I could not claim to be even a\r\n",
      "tyro, and was duly abashed beneath the penetrating eye. But it is\r\n",
      "interesting to think that for a moment once I held the attention of so\r\n",
      "potent a Prospero.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In those days the name of Kirchoff was coupled always with that of\r\n",
      "an associate, the chemist Bunsen, when there was mention of\r\n",
      "spectrum-analysis; and in my time at Heidelberg, Bunsen was at hand\r\n",
      "and I became as familiar with his figure as with Kirchoff. In frame\r\n",
      "Bunsen was of the burly burgomaster type not rare among the Teutons,\r\n",
      "and as I saw him in his laboratory to which I sometimes gained access\r\n",
      "through students of his, he moved about in some kind of informal\r\n",
      "_schlafrock_ or working dress of ample dimensions, with his\r\n",
      "large head crowned by a peculiar cap. On the tables within the spaces\r\n",
      "flickered numerously the \"Bunsen burners,\" his invention, and it\r\n",
      "was easy to fancy as one saw him, surrounded by the large company of\r\n",
      "reverent disciples, that you were in the presence of the hierophant\r\n",
      "of some abstruse and mysterious cult, in whose honour waved the many\r\n",
      "lambent flames. I think he was unmarried, without domestic ties, and\r\n",
      "lived almost night and day among his crucibles and retorts, devoted to\r\n",
      "his science and pupils toward whom he showed a regard almost fatherly.\r\n",
      "In his lecture-room, in more formal dress he was less picturesque, but\r\n",
      "still a man to arouse deep interest. He was in the front rank of the\r\n",
      "chemists of all time, and I suppose had equal merit with Kirchoff in\r\n",
      "the momentous discovery in which their names are linked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was, however, at this time in Heidelberg a scientist probably\r\n",
      "of greater prestige than even these, whose contemporary influence was\r\n",
      "more dominant, and whose repute is now, and likely to be hereafter\r\n",
      "more prevailing. In my walks in a certain quiet street, I sometimes\r\n",
      "met a man who made an unusual impression of dignity and power. He\r\n",
      "had the bearing of a leader of men in whatever sphere he might move,\r\n",
      "massive and well-statured, his dress not obtrusive but carefully\r\n",
      "appointed, with an eye and face to command. His manner was courteous,\r\n",
      "not domineering, and I wondered who the able, high-bred gentleman\r\n",
      "might be, for he carried all that in his air as he passed along the\r\n",
      "street. It was the illustrious Helmholtz, then in his best years,\r\n",
      "with great achievements behind him and before. His researches in many\r\n",
      "fields were profound and far extending. I suppose his genius was\r\n",
      "at its best when dealing with the pervasive imponderable ether that\r\n",
      "extends out from the earth into the vast planetary spaces in whose\r\n",
      "vibrations are conditioned the phenomena of light. No subject of\r\n",
      "investigation can be more elusive. The mind that could grapple with\r\n",
      "this and arrive at the secrets and laws of the subtle medium through\r\n",
      "which the human eye receives impression is indeed worthy of our\r\n",
      "veneration. Probably, excepting Humboldt, no German scientist in these\r\n",
      "later centuries has reached such eminence. The fields of the two\r\n",
      "men were widely different. The one we know best as the scientific\r\n",
      "traveller, roaming the earth over, and reducing to ordered knowledge\r\n",
      "what can be perceived of its fauna and flora, of the strata that\r\n",
      "underlie it, the oceans that toss upon it, the atmosphere that\r\n",
      "surrounds it. The other roved not widely, but keeping to his lenses\r\n",
      "and calculations, penetrated perhaps more profoundly. Helmholtz, a\r\n",
      "well-born youth, began his career as a surgeon in the Prussian army,\r\n",
      "and his service there, no doubt, contributed to the manly carriage\r\n",
      "for which he was conspicuous. He married a lady of a noble house of\r\n",
      "Wuertemberg, and moved in an environment conducive to courtly manners.\r\n",
      "Heidelberg, like the German universities in general well understood\r\n",
      "that ability in its teachers, and not a pompous architectural\r\n",
      "display, makes a great institution. Its buildings were scattered and\r\n",
      "unpretending. Helmholtz had a lecture-room and laboratory apart, in\r\n",
      "a structure modern and graceful, but modest in its appeal. Here he\r\n",
      "discoursed to reverent throngs in tones never loud or confident. It is\r\n",
      "for wiseacres and charlatans to declaim and domineer. The masters\r\n",
      "are deferential in the presence of the sublimities and of the\r\n",
      "intelligences they are striving to enlighten.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Germany I saw the great lights of science from afar, coming into\r\n",
      "relations of intimacy only with one or two _privat-docents_,\r\n",
      "young men struggling precariously for a foothold. One such striver I\r\n",
      "came to know well, a young man gifted but physically crippled, who,\r\n",
      "being anxious to get up his English, as I was to get up my German,\r\n",
      "entered with me into an arrangement to converse in these alternately.\r\n",
      "We were about on a par in our knowledge or ignorance of the speech not\r\n",
      "native to us, and helped each other merrily out of the pitfalls into\r\n",
      "which we stumbled, according as English or German ruled the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was aghast to find that I had been telling my new German\r\n",
      "acquaintances that while a married man, I had _deserted_ and\r\n",
      "_cast off_ my wife and little boy in America, when I meant to\r\n",
      "say only that I had left them behind during my temporary sojourn. A\r\n",
      "treacherous inseparable prefix had imparted to my \"leaving them\" an\r\n",
      "unlooked-for emphasis. The laugh for the moment was on me, but only\r\n",
      "for the moment. A little later Knopff was telling me of the old\r\n",
      "manuscripts in the library illuminated gorgeously by \"de pious and\r\n",
      "skilful monkeys of de Middle Ages.\" He was a bright fellow, and I have\r\n",
      "hoped I might encounter his name in some honourable connection. If he\r\n",
      "survived it was as one of the _unbekannt_, an affix very dreadful\r\n",
      "to young aspirants for university honours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As regards the men who, during the past seventy-five years have so\r\n",
      "greatly widened our scientific knowledge, I have had contact with\r\n",
      "those of Germany only for brief periods, and in the outer circle. As\r\n",
      "to their American brethren, fate has been more kind to me. I have sat\r\n",
      "as a pupil at the feet of the most eminent, and with some I have stood\r\n",
      "in the bond of friendship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Divinity Hall, at Harvard University, has always had a pleasant\r\n",
      "seclusion. Near the end of its long, well-shaded avenue, it had in the\r\n",
      "rear the fine trees of Norton's Woods, and fifty years ago pleasant\r\n",
      "fields stretching before. Of late the Ampelopsis has taken it into its\r\n",
      "especial cherishing, draping it with a close green luxuriance that can\r\n",
      "scarcely be matched elsewhere. Moreover it is dominated by the lordly\r\n",
      "pile of the Museum of Comparative Zoölogy. \"Whence and what art thou,\r\n",

      "feeling that there must always be a battle between what the old Hall\r\n",
      "stood for and the new building was to foster. But the structures have\r\n",
      "gone on in harmony, and many a devotee of science has had hospitable\r\n",
      "welcome in the quarters intended for the recruits of what so many\r\n",
      "suppose to be the opposing camp. There was a notable case of this kind\r\n",
      "in my own time.\r\n",

      "One pleasant afternoon a group of \"divinities\" (Ye gods, that that\r\n",
      "should have been our title in the nomenclature of the University!)\r\n",
      "were chatting under one of the western porches. Talk turned upon an\r\n",
      "instructor, whose hand upon our essays was felt to be soft rather than\r\n",
      "critical, and who was, therefore, set low. \"By Holy Scripture,\" broke\r\n",

      "wrath.\" The window close by opened into the room of Simon Newcomb, a\r\n",
      "youth who had no part in our studies, but of whom we made a chum. In\r\n",
      "those days he could laugh at such a joke as it blew in at his window\r\n",
      "with the thistle-down,--indeed was capable of such things himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is a bit odd that as I come to write of him, this small witticism\r\n",
      "of half a century back should thrust itself obstinately into my\r\n",
      "memory, but after all it may not be out of place. The impression of\r\n",
      "the greatness of a mountain we get powerfully if the eye can measure\r\n",
      "it from the waif of seaweed at low tide up to the snow-cap of the\r\n",
      "summit. At this and similar jokes the boy Simon Newcomb connived, as\r\n",
      "he moved in our crowd. They were the waifs at low tide from which his\r\n",
      "towering mind rose to the measuring of the courses of the stars. He\r\n",
      "came among us as a student of the Lawrence scientific school, muscular\r\n",
      "and heavy-shouldered from work on shore and at the oar in Nova Scotia.\r\n",
      "Though not slovenly, he was the reverse of trim. His rather outlandish\r\n",
      "clothes, pressed once for all when they left the shop of the\r\n",
      "provincial tailor, held his sturdy elbows and knees in bags moulded\r\n",
      "accurately to the capacious joints. His hair hung rebelliously, and\r\n",
      "his nascent beard showed an untrained hand at the razor. But his\r\n",
      "brow was broad, his eye clear and intelligent, and he was a man to\r\n",
      "be reckoned with. He was barely of age, but already a computer in the\r\n",
      "_Nautical Almanac_ office, then located at Cambridge, and we\r\n",
      "well knew work of that sort required brains of the best. Since Simon\r\n",
      "Newcomb's death an interesting story has been told about his heredity.\r\n",
      "His strong-brained father, measuring his own qualities with rigid\r\n",
      "introspection, discovering where he was weak and where capable\r\n",
      "resolved that whatever wife he chose should supplement in her\r\n",
      "personality the points to which he lacked. He would father sons and\r\n",
      "daughters who should come into the world well appointed; in particular\r\n",
      "he looked toward offspring who should possess high scientific gifts.\r\n",
      "With this mind he set out on his courting, and steering clear of vain\r\n",
      "entanglements with rather preternatural coolness, at last in a remote\r\n",
      "village, satisfied himself that he had found his complement. He\r\n",
      "permitted his docile heart to fall in love, and in due course there\r\n",
      "was born into the world a great man. The wooing has a humorous\r\n",
      "aspect,--this steering of unruly Hymen! The calculated result,\r\n",
      "however, did not fail of appearance, and perhaps the world might\r\n",
      "profit from such an example. I was strongly drawn toward Simon Newcomb\r\n",
      "by his unlikeness to myself. I was town-bred and he full of strength\r\n",
      "gained in the fields and along the beach. My own disinclination for\r\n",
      "mathematics was marked, but I had a vast admiration for a man to whom\r\n",
      "its processes were easy. We became very good friends. He was a genial\r\n",
      "fellow, capable as I have said of taking or making a joke, yet his\r\n",
      "moods were prevailingly serious, and he had already hitched his waggon\r\n",
      "to a star. Abnormally purposeful perhaps, a cropping out no doubt of\r\n",
      "heredity, he had set a high mark for himself and was already striving\r\n",
      "toward it. In an autobiographical fragment he says, referring to his\r\n",
      "early surrender of his powers to high mathematical work:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  To this work I was especially attracted, because its\r\n",
      "  preparation seemed to me to embody the highest\r\n",
      "  intellectual power to which man has ever attained.\r\n",
      "  The matter used to present itself to my mind somewhat\r\n",
      "  in this way.... There are tens of thousands\r\n",
      "  of men who could be successful in all the ordinary\r\n",
      "  walks of life. Thousands who could gain wealth,\r\n",
      "  hundreds who could wield empires, for one who\r\n",
      "  could take up the astronomical problems with any\r\n",
      "  hope of success. The men who have done it are\r\n",
      "  therefore in intellect the select few of the human\r\n",
      "  race, an aristocracy ranking above all others in the\r\n",
      "  scale of being. The astronomical _ephemeris_ is the\r\n",
      "  last practical outcome of their productive genius.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In pursuing their lives men no doubt follow the line of least\r\n",
      "resistance, and Simon Newcomb here we may be sure was no exception;\r\n",
      "thus he chose to deal in his work with the heaviest and most\r\n",
      "perplexing problems with which the human intellect can engage. I\r\n",
      "do not attempt to describe or estimate what he achieved. Only a few\r\n",
      "select minds in his generation were capable of that. At his death the\r\n",
      "tributes of those who had a right to speak were unmeasured. Perhaps no\r\n",
      "human mind ever attacked more boldly the uttermost difficulties, and\r\n",
      "indeed have been more successful in the wrestle. He was set by the\r\n",
      "side of Hipparchus, of Galileo, Copernicus, Kepler, and Sir Isaac\r\n",
      "Newton. In a class thus lofty, his scientific fellows have judged\r\n",
      "that he had a title to stand. In their high strivings he was equally\r\n",
      "zealous, and his achievement was comparable with theirs. Nevertheless,\r\n",
      "had his disposition inclined him, there were many other paths into\r\n",
      "which he might have struck with success. His versatility was marked\r\n",
      "and he did try his hand at various tasks, at finance, political\r\n",
      "economy, belles-lettres. James Bryce, who knew him well, is said to\r\n",
      "have seen in him the stuff for a great man-of-affairs, a leader of\r\n",
      "armies or a captain of industry. His excursions, however, into such\r\n",
      "fields, though sometimes noteworthy in result, were transient and more\r\n",
      "or less half-hearted. His allegiance, given so early to the sublimest\r\n",
      "of pursuits, held him to the end. The Government of the United States\r\n",
      "placed him in its highest scientific position, at the head of the\r\n",
      "Naval Observatory, and his serious work from first to last was in the\r\n",
      "solemn labyrinths where the stars cross and re-cross, and here he was\r\n",
      "one of the most masterful of master-minds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was full fifty years since Simon Newcomb and I were boys together\r\n",
      "in Divinity Hall. No letter or message had ever passed between us. I\r\n",
      "had followed the course of his fame, and felt happy that I had once\r\n",
      "known him. Returning to my lodgings, during a sojourn in Washington, I\r\n",
      "was told I had had a visitor, a man well on in years, plain in attire,\r\n",
      "and rugged-faced. The card he left bore the name \"Simon Newcomb.\" I\r\n",
      "sought him out at once, and have rarely felt more honoured than that\r\n",
      "my old friend, learning casually of my whereabouts, had felt\r\n",
      "the impulse to find me and renew our former intercourse. After a\r\n",
      "half-century the boy was still discernible in the aging man. The big\r\n",
      "brow remained and the keen and thoughtful eye. His dress and manner\r\n",
      "were simple, as of old. He was entitled to wear the insignia of a\r\n",
      "rear-admiral, and had long lived in refined surroundings which might\r\n",
      "have made him fastidious. In look and bearing, however, he was the\r\n",
      "hearty, friendly man of the Nova Scotia coast, careless of frills and\r\n",
      "fine manners.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a red-letter day for me when Simon Newcomb met me at the door\r\n",
      "of the Cosmos Club, of which he was then president, and presented\r\n",
      "me as his guest to one and another of the select company of men who\r\n",
      "formed its membership. He moved among them as unostentatious and\r\n",
      "simple-mannered as he had been as a boy, with a catholic interest in\r\n",
      "all the varying topics which held the sympathies of the crowd,\r\n",
      "and able well to hold his own whatever might be the field of the\r\n",
      "conversation. Bishop, poet, scientist, historian, he had common ground\r\n",
      "with them all. I sat with him in his study, among heaped-up papers\r\n",
      "inscribed with the most abstruse and intricate calculations. It did\r\n",
      "not affect the warmth of his welcome that I had no partnership\r\n",
      "with him in these difficult pursuits. He was broad enough to take\r\n",
      "cognizance, too, of the things I cared for. It was hard to feel that\r\n",
      "the man there hitting off aptly a prominent personality or historic\r\n",
      "event mooted in our little human world was at the same time in the\r\n",
      "planetary confidences, and that when you shook his hand at parting,\r\n",
      "he would turn to interpreting the sweet influences of the Pleiades\r\n",
      "and the mysteries of the bands that hold Orion. Coming home from an\r\n",
      "interview with Simon Newcomb, late at night I paused on the terrace at\r\n",
      "the west front of the Capitol and looked back upon the heavens widely\r\n",
      "stretching above the city. The stars glittered cold, far, and silent,\r\n",
      "but I had been with a man who in a sense walked and talked with them\r\n",
      "and found them sympathetic. In the power of pure intellect I felt I\r\n",
      "had never known a greater man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On an autumn day in the early fifties, as I loitered in the\r\n",
      "green-house of the Botanic Garden at Cambridge, a lithe bare-headed\r\n",
      "man, in rough brown attire, came quickly stepping in from the\r\n",
      "flower-beds outside. He was in his fullest vigour, his hair more\r\n",
      "inclined to stand erect than to lie smooth, his dark eyes full of\r\n",
      "animation. It was a noticeably vivid and alert personality, and as he\r\n",
      "tossed on to a working-table a heavy sheaf of long-stemmed plants, wet\r\n",
      "from a recent shower and bent over them in sharp scrutiny, I knew I\r\n",
      "was in the presence of Asa Gray, the first of American botanists.\r\n",
      "He had come as a boy from a remote rural district, and with few\r\n",
      "advantages, following the bent of a marked scientific genius, he had\r\n",
      "won for himself before reaching middle life a leading place. I was\r\n",
      "soon to know him better, for it was my fortunate lot to be one in the\r\n",
      "crowd of juniors which for a term lined up before him once a week\r\n",
      "or so in Holden Chapel. The small peculiarities of great men have an\r\n",
      "interest, and the function I am seeking now to fulfil is to make sharp\r\n",
      "the ordinary presentment of the eminent characters I touch. I\r\n",
      "recall of Asa Gray, that with the class, he sat at his desk behind a\r\n",
      "substantial rail, which fenced him in from the boys in the front row,\r\n",
      "his seat a little raised and the notes before him made plain by a\r\n",
      "narrow light-well, which in the Holden of those days opened over the\r\n",
      "teacher's head to a sky-light in the roof. Gray's utterance was rather\r\n",
      "hesitant. He would catch for his word often, reiterating meanwhile\r\n",
      "the article, \"the-a, the-a, the-a,\" his gaze meanwhile fixed upon\r\n",
      "the sky-light, and a nervously gyrating forefinger raised high and\r\n",
      "brightly illuminated. The thought suggested was that he had a prompter\r\n",
      "on the roof to whom he was distressfully appealing to supply the true\r\n",
      "phrase. For Professor Gray the truth was in the top rather than the\r\n",
      "bottom of the well. Though sometimes long in coming it was the right\r\n",
      "thing when it came and clothed his thought properly. Sizing up the\r\n",
      "new professor, in our first days with him, as boys will do, some\r\n",
      "unconscionable dogs in our front row, assuming an attitude which\r\n",
      "Abraham Lincoln afterward made classic, settled back in their chairs\r\n",
      "and rested their feet on the rail in front in a position higher than\r\n",
      "their heads. The professor, withdrawing his gaze suddenly from the\r\n",
      "sky-light, found himself confronted not by expectant faces but by\r\n",
      "a row of battered and muddy boot-soles. His face fell; his whirling\r\n",
      "forefinger, ceasing to gyrate, tilted like a lance in rest at the\r\n",
      "obnoxious cowhide parapet. \"Those boots, young gentlemen, ah, those\r\n",
      "boots\"; he ejaculated forlornly, and the boots came down with mutinous\r\n",
      "clatter. Professor Gray soon established himself as a prime favourite\r\n",
      "among our lazy men, of whom there were too many. In calling us up he\r\n",
      "began with the A's, following down the class in alphabetic regularity.\r\n",
      "While Brooks was reciting, it was easy for Brown, sitting next, to\r\n",
      "open his book, and calculating narrowly the parallax, to hold\r\n",
      "it concealed below the rail, while he diligently conned the page\r\n",
      "following. In his turn he rose well-primed, and spouted glibly, and so\r\n",
      "on down the class. Rumour went that our childlike professor declared\r\n",
      "he had never known anything like it. Nearly every man got the perfect\r\n",
      "mark. This was a fiction. The professor's idea was that we were old\r\n",
      "enough to know what was good for us, and ought to be above childish\r\n",
      "negligence and tricks. If some men saw no use in botany, he would\r\n",
      "not waste time in beating it into them. He left the blind and the\r\n",
      "sluggards in their wilful ignorance, but had generously helpful hands\r\n",
      "for all wiser ones who saw the value of trimming their lamps. All such\r\n",
      "he would take to his garden personally to direct and inspire, and\r\n",
      "our better men felt all through their lives how much that meant. In\r\n",
      "general we soon came to feel and appreciate a most kindly influence\r\n",
      "as proceeding from him. I think we had no teacher whom we at the last\r\n",
      "regarded more affectionately or approached more closely; and many an\r\n",
      "indolent one was won to warm interest and diligence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Those were the days when the older science was rocking to its\r\n",
      "foundations in a re-shaping at the hands of new and brilliant men.\r\n",
      "Faraday, we might have heard of, but Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall, and the\r\n",
      "rest, were names all unknown, as were also the revolutionary ideas,\r\n",
      "the conservation and correlation of forces, the substitution of\r\n",
      "evolution in the scheme of the universe for the plan of special\r\n",
      "creations. Here all unconsciously we were in contact with a man\r\n",
      "who was in the thick of the new scientific movement, the friend and\r\n",
      "partner in their strivings of the daring new interpreters of the\r\n",
      "ways of God to men, and who was to have recognition as a specially\r\n",
      "effective apostle of the new dispensation. Abraham himself entertained\r\n",
      "his angel no more unawares than we, but gleams of fine radiance\r\n",
      "sometimes broke through even to our purblind perceptions. Once\r\n",
      "unfurling a quite too long and heedless pair of ears to what I\r\n",
      "supposed would be a dull technical deliverance, I found myself\r\n",
      "suddenly caught and wonderfully stimulated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  What [said Asa Gray] is the bright flame and vivid\r\n",
      "  heat that is set free on your hearth when you kindle\r\n",
      "  your piles of wood? It is the sunlight and sun-heat\r\n",
      "  of a century ago. The beams were caught in\r\n",
      "  the wilderness by the leaves of the trees; they were\r\n",
      "  absorbed and stored in the trunks, and the light\r\n",
      "  and heat day by day through many years was thus\r\n",
      "  heaped up. When now combustion begins, it is\r\n",
      "  simply a setting free of the radiance that was shed\r\n",
      "  upon the forest many years ago. The noons of a\r\n",
      "  time long past are making you comfortable in the\r\n",
      "  wintry storm of the present. So when the anthracite\r\n",
      "  glows in your grate, you feel the veritable\r\n",
      "  sunbeams that were emitted aeons upon aeons ago\r\n",
      "  upon the primeval world. It is the very light that\r\n",
      "  was drunk in by those most ancient forests. It was\r\n",
      "  held fast in the trunks, and when those faithful\r\n",
      "  reservoirs in their turn were crushed and commingled\r\n",
      "  and drenched until at last they lay under\r\n",
      "  the earth as the coal beds, they nevertheless held\r\n",
      "  fast this treasure. When you scratch your match\r\n",
      "  you but unlock the hoard, and the sunlight of\r\n",
      "  primeval days, diminished by no particle, glows and\r\n",
      "  warms once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This in substance was Asa Gray's introduction from which he went on\r\n",
      "to explain that in the progress of the universe no faintest throb of\r\n",
      "energy is lost. It might pass from form to form; heat might appear\r\n",
      "as a mode of motion, of weight, of elasticity, but no smallest unit\r\n",
      "perished. So the lecture flowed on into a luminous and comprehensive\r\n",
      "exposition of the great doctrine of the conservation and correlation\r\n",
      "of force. It was Asa Gray who brought us into touch with this new\r\n",
      "science just then announcing itself to the world. He was a co-worker\r\n",
      "and a compeer of the pioneers who at that moment were breaking a way\r\n",
      "for it, and it was our privilege to sit at the feet of a master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In later years his fame spread wide. He was recognised as the leader\r\n",
      "in America in his special field, and in a class with the best men\r\n",
      "of foreign lands. He was long a correspondent and special friend of\r\n",
      "Darwin, to the spread of whose doctrines he rendered great service.\r\n",
      "The fact that religiously he adhered to the time-honoured evangelical\r\n",
      "tenets helped much in the war which the new science was forced to wage\r\n",
      "with the _odium theologicum_. The new science, it must be said,\r\n",
      "perhaps has hardly yet made sure its footing. Are Natural Selection\r\n",
      "and Survival of the Fittest clews with which we can face confidently\r\n",
      "the workings of the \"roaring-gloom that weaves for God the garment we\r\n",
      "see him by\"? But no doctrine is better accepted than that in some way\r\n",
      "Evolution and not Special Creations is the scheme of the world. Toward\r\n",
      "this acceptance Asa Gray helped powerfully, a champion always bold,\r\n",
      "humane, broad-minded. We used to laugh about the prompter he seemed to\r\n",
      "have at the top of the light-well in the sky-light in Holden Chapel.\r\n",
      "In a deeper sense than we knew the good man received his prompting\r\n",
      "from the clear upper sky.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A naturalist who sixty years ago had, and perhaps still has, a much\r\n",
      "wider fame than Asa Gray was Louis Agassiz. He had come a few\r\n",
      "years before from Europe, a man in his prime, of great fame. He was\r\n",
      "strikingly handsome, with a dome-like head under flowing black locks,\r\n",
      "large dark, mobile eyes set in features strong and comely, and with\r\n",
      "a well-proportioned stalwart frame. At the moment his prestige was\r\n",
      "greater, perhaps, than that of any other Harvard professor. His\r\n",
      "knowledge seemed almost boundless. His glacial theory had put him\r\n",
      "among the geological chiefs, and as to animated nature he had ordered\r\n",
      "and systematised, from the lowest plant-forms up to the crown of\r\n",
      "creation, the human being. Abroad we knew he was held to be an adept\r\n",
      "in the most difficult fields and now in his new environment he was\r\n",
      "pushing his investigations with passionate zeal. But the boys found in\r\n",
      "him points on which a laugh could be hung. As he strode homeward from\r\n",
      "his walks in the outer fields or marshes, we eyed him gingerly, for\r\n",
      "who could tell what he might have in his pockets? Turtles, tadpoles,\r\n",
      "snakes, any old monster might be there, and queer stories prevailed\r\n",
      "of the menagerie which, hung up, and forgotten in the professor's\r\n",
      "dressing-room, crept out and sought asylum in the beds, shoes, and\r\n",
      "hats of the household. Before the resulting consternation, masculine\r\n",
      "and feminine, he was always apologetic. He was on the friendliest\r\n",
      "terms with things ill-reputed, even abhorrent, and could not\r\n",
      "understand the qualms of the delicate. He was said to have held up\r\n",
      "once, in all innocence, before a class of school-girls a wriggling\r\n",
      "snake. The shrieks and confusion brought him to a sense of what he had\r\n",
      "done. He apologised elaborately, the foreign peculiarity he never lost\r\n",
      "running through his confusion. \"Poor girls, I vill not do it again.\r\n",
      "Next time I vill bring in a nice, clean leetle feesh.\" Agassiz took no\r\n",
      "pleasure in shocking his class; on the contrary he was most anxious to\r\n",
      "engage and hold them. So too, if his audience was made up from people\r\n",
      "of the simplest. In fact, for each he exerted his powers as generously\r\n",
      "as when addressing a company of savants. He always kindled as he\r\n",
      "spoke, and with a marvellous magnetism communicated his glow to those\r\n",
      "who listened. I have seen him stand before his class holding in his\r\n",
      "hand the claw of a crustacean. In his earnestness it seemed to be for\r\n",
      "him the centre of the creation, and he made us all share his belief.\r\n",
      "Indeed, he convinced us. Running back from it in an almost infinite\r\n",
      "series was the many-ordered life adhering at last and scarcely\r\n",
      "distinguishable from the inorganic matter to which it clung. Forward\r\n",
      "from it again ran the series not less long and complicated which\r\n",
      "fulfilled itself at last in the brain and soul of man. What he held in\r\n",
      "his hand was a central link. His colour came and went, his eye danced\r\n",
      "and his tones grew deep and tremulous, as he dwelt on the illimitable\r\n",
      "chain of being. With a few strokes on the blackboard, he presented\r\n",
      "graphically the most intricate variations. He felt the sublimity of\r\n",
      "what he was contemplating, and we glowed with him from the contagion\r\n",
      "of his fervour. I have never heard his equal as an expounder of the\r\n",
      "deep things of nature. He gloried in the exercise of his power, though\r\n",
      "hampered by poverty. \"I have no time to make money,\" he cried. He\r\n",
      "sought no title but that of teacher. To do anything else was only to\r\n",
      "misuse his gift. In his desk he was an inspirer, but hardly more so\r\n",
      "than in private talk. I recall walks we took with him to study natural\r\n",
      "objects and especially the striated rocks, which, as he had detected,\r\n",
      "bore plain evidence that the configuration of the region had been\r\n",
      "shaped by glaciers. He was charmingly affable, encouraging our\r\n",
      "questions, and unwearied in his demonstration. \"Professor,\" I said\r\n",
      "once, \"you teach us that in creation things rise from high to higher\r\n",
      "in the vast series until at last we come to man. Why stop with man?\r\n",
      "why not conclude that as man surpasses what went before, so he in turn\r\n",
      "will be surpassed and supplanted by a being still superior;--and so on\r\n",
      "and on?\" I well recall the solemnity of his face as he replied that\r\n",
      "I was touching upon the deepest things, not to be dealt with in an\r\n",
      "afternoon ramble. He would only say then that there could be nothing\r\n",
      "higher than a man with his spirit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether Agassiz was as broad-minded as he was high-minded may be\r\n",
      "argued. The story ran that when the foundations of the Museum of\r\n",
      "Comparative Zoölogy were going on in Divinity Avenue, a theological\r\n",
      "professor encountering the scientist among the shadows the latter was\r\n",
      "invading, courteously bade him welcome. He hoped the old Divinity Hall\r\n",
      "would be a good neighbour to the pile rising opposite. \"Yes,\" was the\r\n",
      "bluff reply, \"and I hope to see the time when it will be turned into\r\n",
      "a dormitory for my scientific students.\" They were quickly spoken,\r\n",
      "unmeditated words without intention of rudeness, but wrapped in his\r\n",
      "specialty he was rather careless as to what he might shoulder out.\r\n",
      "Again, we had in our company a delicate, nervous fellow who turned\r\n",
      "out to be a spiritualistic medium, and who was soon subjected to an\r\n",
      "investigation in which professors took part, which was certainly rough\r\n",
      "and ready. Agassiz speedily came to the conclusion that the young\r\n",
      "man was an impostor and deserved no mercy. Some of us felt that\r\n",
      "the determination was hasty. There was a possibility of honest\r\n",
      "self-deception; and then who could say that the mysteries had been\r\n",
      "fathomed that involved the play of the psychic forces? Possibly a\r\n",
      "calmer and more candid mood might have befitted the investigation.\r\n",
      "At any rate in these later days such a mood has been maintained by\r\n",
      "inquirers like William James and the Society for Psychical Research.\r\n",
      "These are straws, but it is hardly a straw that when Darwinism emerged\r\n",
      "upon the world, winning such speedy and almost universal adherence\r\n",
      "among scientific men and revolutionising in general the thought of\r\n",
      "the world as to the method of creation, Agassiz stood almost solitary\r\n",
      "among authorities rejecting evolution and clinging to the doctrine of\r\n",
      "a special calling into being of each species. His stand against the\r\n",
      "new teaching was definite and bold, but can it be called broad-minded?\r\n",
      "This is but the limitation that makes human a greatness which the\r\n",
      "world regards with thorough and affectionate reverence. Fortunate\r\n",
      "are those in whose memories live the voice and countenance of Louis\r\n",
      "Agassiz.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Those whose privilege it was to know both father and son will be slow\r\n",
      "to admit that the elder Agassiz was the greater man. Alexander (to\r\n",
      "his intimates he was always, affectionately, Alex), was a teacher only\r\n",
      "transiently, and I believe never before a class showed the enkindling\r\n",
      "power which in the father was so marked a gift. His attainments,\r\n",
      "however, were probably not less great, and it remains to be seen\r\n",
      "whether his discoveries were not as epoch-making. He possessed,\r\n",
      "moreover, a versatility which his father never showed (perhaps because\r\n",
      "he never took time to show it), standing as a brilliant figure\r\n",
      "among financiers and captains of industry. Finally, in a high sense,\r\n",
      "Alexander was a philanthropist, and his benefactions were no more\r\n",
      "munificent than they were wisely applied; for he watched well his\r\n",
      "generous hand, guiding the flow into channels where it might most\r\n",
      "effectually revive and enrich. While possibly in the case of the elder\r\n",
      "Agassiz, the recognition of truth was sometimes unduly circumscribed,\r\n",
      "that could never be said of Alexander. He was eminently broad-minded,\r\n",

      "take his place in our class--a handsome fellow, brown-eyed, and\r\n",
      "dark-haired, trimly built, and well-grown for his years. His face had\r\n",
      "a foreign air, and when he spoke a peculiarity marked his speech. This\r\n",
      "he never lost, but it was no imperfection. Rather it gave distinction\r\n",
      "to his otherwise perfect English. In the years of our course, we met\r\n",
      "daily. He was a good general scholar but with a preference from the\r\n",
      "first for natural science and mathematics. He matured into handsome\r\n",
      "manhood, and as an athlete was among the best. He was a master of the\r\n",
      "oar, not dropping it on graduation, but long a familiar figure on the\r\n",

      "the city to find some proper head-gear. He presently returned with\r\n",
      "a package of handkerchiefs of crimson, which so demonstrated their\r\n",

      "Company is a kind of commercial romance which the harshest critics\r\n",
      "of American business life may read with pleasure. At the same time\r\n",

      "always with haste from the mine and the counting-room to the\r\n",
      "protracted scientific researches in which his heart mainly lay. His\r\n",
      "voyages in the interest of science were many and long. He studied\r\n",
      "not so much the shores as the sea itself. Oceanographer is the term\r\n",
      "perhaps by which he may best be designated. By deep sea soundings\r\n",
      "he mapped the vast beds over which the waters roll and reached an\r\n",

      "at a class dinner, an affair of dress-suits, baked meats, and cigars\r\n",
      "at the finish, I found his talk took one far away from the prose of\r\n",
      "the thing. He was charming in conversation, and he set forth at length\r\n",
      "his theory as to the work of the coral insects, formed after long\r\n",
      "study of the barrier reefs and atolls of remote seas. His ideas were\r\n",
      "subversive of those of Darwin, with whom he disputed the matter before\r\n",
      "Darwin died. They are now well-known and I think accepted, though\r\n",
      "unfortunately he died before setting them forth in due order. They are\r\n",
      "revolutionary in their character as to the origin of formations that\r\n",
      "enter largely into the crust of the earth. In this field he stood as\r\n",
      "originator and chief. He gave me glimpses of the wonderful indeed,\r\n",
      "as we cracked our almonds and sipped the sherbet, his rich voice and\r\n",
      "slightly foreign accent running at my ear as we sat under the banquet\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Though oceanography was his special field, his tastes and attainments\r\n",
      "were comprehensive and he was a man of repute in many ways. He was a\r\n",
      "trained and skilled engineer and mathematician, and an adept in the\r\n",
      "most various branches of natural science. At another class dinner,\r\n",
      "when I was so fortunate as to sit beside him, his interest in botany\r\n",
      "came out as he spoke of the enjoyment he took in surveying from the\r\n",
      "roof of the Museum of Comparative Zoölogy the trees of Cambridge, the\r\n",
      "masses of foliage here and there appearing from that point in special\r\n",
      "beauty. I spoke of the paper just read by Francis Darwin, the son of\r\n",
      "Charles, before the British Association, emphasising the idea that\r\n",
      "the life of plants and animals differs not in kind but only in degree.\r\n",
      "Plants may have memory, perhaps show passion, predatory instincts, or\r\n",
      "rudimentary intelligence. The plant-world is therefore part and parcel\r\n",
      "of animated nature. Agassiz announced with real fervour his adherence\r\n",
      "to that belief and cited interesting facts in its support. Subtle\r\n",
      "links binding plant and animal reveal themselves everywhere to\r\n",
      "investigation. In evolution from the primeval monads, or whatever\r\n",
      "starting-points there were, the fittest always survived as the\r\n",
      "outpoured life flowed abundantly along the million lines of\r\n",
      "development. There was a brotherhood between man and not only the\r\n",
      "zoöphyte, but still further down, even with the ultimate cell in which\r\n",
      "organisation can first be traced, only faintly distinguishable from\r\n",
      "the azoic rock on which it hangs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he talked I thought of the ample spaces of his Museum where the\r\n",
      "whole great scheme is made manifest to the eye, the structure of man,\r\n",
      "then the slow gradation downward, the immense series of flowers and\r\n",
      "plants counterfeited in glass continuing the line unbroken, down to\r\n",
      "the ultimate lichen, all but part and parcel of the ledge to which it\r\n",
      "clings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My tastes were not in the direction of mathematics or natural science,\r\n",
      "and it was not until our later years that we came into close touch. In\r\n",
      "the hospice of the Grimsel, in the heart of the Alps, as I sat down\r\n",
      "to dinner after a day of hard walking, I saw my classmate in a remote\r\n",
      "part of the room with his wife and children and a group of Swiss\r\n",
      "friends. I determined not to intrude, but as the dinner ended, coming\r\n",
      "from his place he sought me out. \"I heard your voice,\" he said, \"and\r\n",
      "knew you were here before I saw you.\" We chatted genially. That\r\n",
      "day, he said, he had visited the site of his father's hut on the\r\n",
      "Aar glacier, where the observations were made on which was based the\r\n",
      "glacial theory. On that visit he had, as a small boy, been carried up\r\n",
      "in a basket on the back of a guide. He had not been there since until\r\n",
      "that day. He was that night in the environment into which he had been\r\n",
      "born, and assumed toward me the attitude of a host making at home\r\n",
      "a stranger guest. To my question as to how a transient passer like\r\n",
      "myself could best see a great ice river, he replied, \"Climb to-morrow\r\n",
      "the Aeggisch-horn, and look down from there upon the Aletsch glacier.\r\n",
      "You will have under your eye all the more interesting and important\r\n",
      "phenomena relating to the matter.\" We parted next morning. I had\r\n",
      "enjoyed a great privilege, for he was the man of all men to meet in\r\n",
      "such a place,--a feeling deepened a day or two later, when I looked\r\n",
      "down from the peak he had indicated upon this wide-stretching glacier\r\n",
      "below.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As age drew on he mellowed well. Perhaps sympathy with men and things\r\n",
      "outside his special walk was no stronger than in earlier years, but\r\n",
      "it had readier expression. I heard from him this good story. President\r\n",
      "Eliot was once showing about the university a multimillionaire and his\r\n",
      "wife who had the good purpose to endow a great school of learning in\r\n",
      "the West. Having made the survey, they stood in Memorial Hall, about\r\n",
      "to say good-bye. \"Well, Mr. Eliot,\" said the wife, \"How much money\r\n",
      "have you invested?\" Mr. Eliot stated to her the estimated value of the\r\n",
      "university assets. The lady turning to her husband, exclaimed, with a\r\n",
      "touch of the feeling that money will buy everything, \"Oh, husband,\r\n",
      "we can do better than that.\" Said Mr. Eliot, with a wave of the hand\r\n",
      "toward the ancient portraits on the walls: \"Madame, we have one thing\r\n",
      "which money cannot buy,--nearly three centuries of devotedness!\" There\r\n",
      "is fine appreciation of a precious possession in this remark. In other\r\n",
      "ways Harvard may be surpassed. Other institutions may easily have more\r\n",
      "money, more students. As able men may be in other faculties possibly\r\n",
      "(I will admit even this) there may be elsewhere better football. But\r\n",
      "that through eight generations there has been in the hearts of the\r\n",
      "best men, a constant all-absorbing devotion to the institution, is\r\n",
      "a thing for America unique, and which cannot be taken away. How\r\n",
      "stimulating is this to a noble loyalty in these later generations!\r\n",
      "The old college is a thing to be watchfully and tenderly shielded. As\r\n",
      "Alexander told me the story, I felt in his manner and intonation that\r\n",
      "the three centuries of devotedness had had great influence with him.\r\n",
      "As John Harvard had been the first of the liberal givers, so he was\r\n",
      "the last, and I suppose the greatest. The money value of his gifts\r\n",
      "is very large, but who will put a value upon the labour, the\r\n",
      "watchfulness, the expert guidance exercised by such a man, unrequited\r\n",
      "and almost without intermission throughout a long life! His fine\r\n",
      "nature, no doubt, prompted the consecration, but the old devotedness\r\n",
      "spurred him to emulation of those who had gone before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In 1909 I enjoyed through Agassiz a great pleasure. He invited me to\r\n",
      "his house where I found gathered a company of his friends, many of\r\n",
      "them men of eminence. He had just returned from his journey in East\r\n",
      "Africa, during which he had penetrated far into the interior, studying\r\n",
      "with his usual diligence the natural history of the regions. He\r\n",
      "entertained us with an informal talk beautifully and profusely\r\n",
      "illustrated by photographs. I have said that he did not possess, or at\r\n",
      "any rate, never showed his father's power of kindling speech. So far\r\n",
      "as I know he never addressed large popular audiences. Nevertheless to\r\n",
      "a circle of scientific specialists, or people intelligent in a general\r\n",
      "way, he could present a subject charmingly, in clear, calm, fluent\r\n",
      "speech. On this occasion he was at his best, and it was a pleasure\r\n",
      "indeed to have the marvels of that freshly-opened land described to\r\n",
      "us by the man who of all men perhaps was best able to cope with the\r\n",
      "story. I listened with delight and awe. He was an old man crowned with\r\n",
      "the highest distinctions. I thought of the young handsome boy I had\r\n",
      "seen coming down in his grey suit into the Beacon Street mall, while\r\n",
      "the band played Fair Harvard. On the threshold I shook his hand and\r\n",
      "looked into his dark, kindly eyes. I turned away in the darkness and\r\n",
      "saw him no more.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In 1887, in pleasant June weather I left St. Louis with my family on\r\n",
      "the capacious river-packet _Saint Paul_, for a trip up-stream to\r\n",
      "the city for which the boat was named. The flood was at the full as we\r\n",
      "ploughed on, stopping at landings on either side, the reaches between\r\n",
      "presenting long perspectives of summer beauty. We paused in due course\r\n",
      "at a little Iowa town, and among the passengers who took the boat here\r\n",
      "were two men who excited our attention at the landing. One was a\r\n",
      "tall handsome fellow in early manhood, well-dressed and mannered,\r\n",
      "completely blind. The other was his companion, a rather dishevelled\r\n",
      "figure with neglected beard and hair setting off a face that looked\r\n",
      "out somewhat helplessly into a world strange to it, an attire of loose\r\n",
      "white wool, plainly made by some tailor who knew nothing of recent\r\n",
      "fashion-plates. A close-fitting cap of the same material surmounted\r\n",
      "his head. The attire was whole and neat, but the air of the man was\r\n",
      "slouchy and bespoke one who must have lately come from the outskirts\r\n",
      "into the life of America. The young blindman at once aroused earnest\r\n",
      "sympathy. Of the other some one remarked, \"Plainly a globe-trotting\r\n",
      "Englishman, who has lost his Baedeker and by chance got in here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently the boat was on its way, and as I sat facing the changing\r\n",
      "scene, I heard a shuffling, hesitating step behind, and a drawling\r\n",
      "somewhat uncertain voice asked me about the country. I replied that it\r\n",
      "was my first trip and I was ignorant. Turning full upon the querist,\r\n",
      "no other than the globe-trotter, I said: \"You are an Englishman I see.\r\n",
      "I was in England last year. I have spent some time in London, and I\r\n",
      "know other parts of your country.\" A conversation followed which soon\r\n",
      "became to me interesting. My companion had education and intelligence,\r\n",
      "and before the afternoon ended we were agreeably in touch. He handed\r\n",
      "me his card on which was engraved the name, \"Mr. William Grey.\" I told\r\n",
      "him I was a Harvard man, a professor in Washington University, St.\r\n",
      "Louis. He was of Exeter College, Oxford, and for some years had been a\r\n",
      "professor in Codrington College, Barbadoes, in the West Indies, whence\r\n",
      "he had lately come. To my natural surprise that he should be so far\r\n",
      "astray, he said he had been visiting a fellow Exeter man, a clergyman\r\n",
      "of the English Church, who was the rector of an Iowa parish. It\r\n",
      "further developed that his young blind companion belonged to a family\r\n",
      "in the parish, and that Mr. Grey had good-heartedly assumed the care\r\n",
      "of him during an outing on the river.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A trip from St. Louis to St. Paul by river is longer now than a trip\r\n",
      "across the Atlantic. I was nearly a week in my new companionship, and\r\n",
      "acquaintance grew and deepened fast. The young blindman, whose manners\r\n",
      "were agreeable, became a general favourite, and Mr. Grey and I found\r\n",
      "we had much in common. I mentioned to him that my errand in England\r\n",
      "the year before had been to find material for a life of Young Sir\r\n",
      "Henry Vane, the statesman and martyr of the English Commonwealth, and\r\n",
      "in his young days a governor of the province of Massachusetts Bay.\r\n",
      "This touched in him a responsive chord. He was familiar with the\r\n",
      "period and the character. He was a friend of Shorthouse whose novel,\r\n",
      "_John Inglesant_ was a widely-read book of those days. He had\r\n",
      "helped Shorthouse in his researches for the book, and knew well\r\n",
      "the story of Charles I., and his friends and foes. He was himself\r\n",
      "a staunch Churchman, but mentioned with some pleasure that his name\r\n",
      "appeared among the Non-conformists. A sturdy noble of those days was\r\n",
      "Lord Grey of Groby, who opposed the King to the last, standing at the\r\n",
      "right hand of the redoubtable Colonel Pride at the famous \"Pride's\r\n",
      "Purge,\" pointing out to him the Presbyterians whom the Ironside was to\r\n",
      "turn out of Parliament, in the thick of the crisis. To my inquiry as\r\n",
      "to whether Lord Grey of Groby was an ancestor, he was reticent, merely\r\n",
      "saying that the name was the same. I had begun to surmise that my new\r\n",
      "friend was allied with the Greys who in so many periods of English\r\n",
      "history have borne a famous part. Some years before, while sojourning\r\n",
      "in a little town on the Ohio River, a stroll carried me to a coal-mine\r\n",
      "in the neighbourhood. As I peered down two hundred feet into the dark\r\n",
      "shaft, a bluff, peremptory voice called to me to look out for my head.\r\n",
      "I drew back in time to escape the cage as it descended with a group\r\n",
      "of miners from a higher plane to the lower deeps. I thanked my bluff\r\n",
      "friend, who had saved my head from a bump. A pleasant acquaintance\r\n",
      "followed which led to his taking me down into the mine, a thrilling\r\n",
      "experience. He was an adventurous Englishman who had put money into a\r\n",
      "far-away enterprise, and come with his wife and children to take care\r\n",
      "of it. His wife was a lady well-born, a sister of Sir George Grey,\r\n",
      "twice governor of New Zealand, and at the time High Commissioner and\r\n",
      "governor of Cape Colony, one of the most interesting of the great\r\n",
      "English nation-makers of the South Seas. I came to know the lady,\r\n",
      "and naturally followed the career of her brother, who earned a noble\r\n",
      "reputation. Later I corresponded with him, and received from him his\r\n",
      "portrait and books. Referring to Sir George Grey in my talk with Mr.\r\n",
      "William Grey, I found that he knew him well and not long before, in\r\n",
      "a voyage of which he had made many into many seas, had visited New\r\n",
      "Zealand, and been a guest of Sir George Grey at his island-home in\r\n",
      "the harbour of Auckland. Was he related to Sir George? was my natural\r\n",
      "query. Again there was reticence. The name was the same, but the Greys\r\n",
      "were numerous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The journey wore on. The resource of the steamer's company was to sit\r\n",
      "on the upper deck, watch the swollen river with its waifs of uprooted\r\n",
      "trees and the banks green with the summer, chatting ourselves\r\n",
      "into intimacy. The young blindman made good and very good, and\r\n",
      "his guardian, while keeping a lookout on his charge from under his\r\n",
      "well-worn traveller's cap, which I now knew had sheltered its owner\r\n",
      "in tropic hurricanes and icy Arctic blasts, discussed with me matters\r\n",
      "various and widely related. Nearing our journey's end, we sat in the\r\n",
      "moonlight, the Mississippi opening placidly before us between hazy\r\n",
      "hills. We had grown to be chums, and next morning we were to part. It\r\n",
      "was a time for confidences. \"Well,\" said Mr. Grey, \"I am going to\r\n",
      "get a good look at America, then I mean to return home and go into\r\n",
      "Parliament.\" I suggested there might be difficulties about that.\r\n",
      "English elections were uncertain, and how could he be at all sure that\r\n",
      "any constituency would want him. \"Ah,\" said he, this time no longer\r\n",
      "reticent. \"I am going into the House of Lords.\" \"Indeed,\" said I in\r\n",
      "surprise, \"and who are you really, Mr. William Grey?\" At last he\r\n",
      "was outspoken. He was heir to the earldom of Stamford, his uncle the\r\n",
      "present earl, a man past eighty, childless, and in infirm health,\r\n",
      "must soon lay down the title. He was preparing himself for the\r\n",
      "responsibilities of the high position and believed it well to make a\r\n",
      "study of America. His father, a younger son, had been a clergyman in\r\n",
      "Canada, and he, though with an Oxford training, knew the world outside\r\n",
      "of England better than the old home. His direct ancestor was Lord Grey\r\n",
      "of Groby, whose father, an earl of Stamford, had been a Parliamentary\r\n",
      "commander in the years of the Civil War, and in the century before\r\n",
      "that, a flower of the house had been the Lady Jane Grey, who had\r\n",
      "perished in her youth on the scaffold, a possible heir to the English\r\n",
      "crown. So this _outré_ personage, good-heartedly helping the\r\n",
      "blindman to an outing, and in a shy apologetic way getting into touch\r\n",
      "with an environment strange to him, was a high-born nobleman fitting\r\n",
      "himself for his dignities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had before invited Mr. Grey to visit me in St. Louis, for his\r\n",
      "seeming helplessness appealed to me from the first. He had met some\r\n",
      "hard rebuffs in his American contacts. I thought I might aid him in\r\n",
      "making his way. Returning in the autumn to my home, I heard from Mr.\r\n",
      "Grey that he was coming to be my guest, and in due time he arrived. I\r\n",
      "missed him at the station, but he presently appeared at our door in an\r\n",
      "express-waggon, sitting on the seat with the driver, in the midst of\r\n",
      "his belongings. He spent a week with us in the first American home he\r\n",
      "had known, and we found him an amiable and unobtrusive gentleman.\r\n",
      "He was a vigorous walker and explored the city well. His listless,\r\n",
      "seemingly inattentive eyes somehow scanned everything, and he judged\r\n",
      "well what he witnessed. He was an accomplished scholar and had a quiet\r\n",
      "humour. A little daughter half-playfully and half-wilfully, announced\r\n",
      "her intention to follow her own pleasure in a certain case. \"Milicent\r\n",
      "is a Hedonist,\" said the guest, and the Oxford scholar brought\r\n",
      "Aristippus and Epicurus into odd conjunction with a Mississippi Valley\r\n",
      "breakfast-table. He laid aside his white woollen suit, but his attire\r\n",
      "remained unconventional, not to say _outré_. Even the wrinkled\r\n",
      "dress-suit in which he appeared at dinner, I think was the achievement\r\n",
      "of a tailor in the island of Barbadoes. His opera-hat was a wonder. He\r\n",

      "of it, but he had in some way ascertained it, and I presently found\r\n",
      "myself following his lead down a rather squalid street where at last\r\n",
      "we came to the humble temple. Instead of hearing the bishop, a famous\r\n",
      "and eloquent man, he preferred to sit on a bare bench in the obscure\r\n",
      "little meeting-house, where he fraternised cordially with the dusky\r\n",
      "company we found there. He was more interested in our charities than\r\n",
      "in our politics and business, and in his quiet way during the week\r\n",
      "learned the story well. I introduced him to Southern friends who gave\r\n",
      "him letters to persons in the South. Provided with these he bade us\r\n",
      "good-bye at last, and went far and wide through what had been\r\n",
      "the Confederacy. He visited Jefferson Davis and many soldiers and\r\n",
      "politicians of note, getting at first-hand their point of view. I also\r\n",
      "gave him letters to some eminent men in the East, which he presented,\r\n",
      "meeting with a good reception. He made a wide and shrewd study of the\r\n",
      "United States, and I am glad to think I helped him. When I met him\r\n",
      "he was unfriended and without credentials, and his singularities\r\n",

      "English vicarage. In the House of Lords he was not prominent, though\r\n",

      "worked much in the east end of London, throwing the weight of his\r\n",
      "culture and high position into alleviating ignorance and poverty. He\r\n",

      "with their interesting historic names. Though rigidly a Churchman he\r\n",
      "was not narrow. Lord Stamford sent me a handsome picture of himself,\r\n",
      "to which is affixed his signature as an earl and an elaborate seal. In\r\n",
      "an accompanying note he wrote that the seal was a careful facsimile of\r\n",

      "which forty years ago still held its place on the Alpine roads. I\r\n",
      "stood at the door of the inn, observing the company who were to be\r\n",
      "my fellow-passengers. There were two or three from the outside world,\r\n",
      "like myself, a few mountaineers with suggestions of the Tyrol in their\r\n",

      "from head to foot. A knotted cord bound his waist, the ends depending\r\n",
      "toward the pavement and swinging with his rosary. His feet were shod\r\n",
      "with sandals, and his head was bare, though an ample cowl was at hand\r\n",
      "to shelter it. His head needed no tonsure for age had made him nearly\r\n",
      "bald. His shaven face was kind and strong and he was in genial touch\r\n",
      "with the by-standers, to whom no doubt such a figure was not novel.\r\n",
      "Incongruously enough, the friar held over his head in the pouring rain\r\n",

      "Presently we climbed in for the journey, and I was a trifle taken\r\n",

      "he wrapped in the coarse folds of his monkish robe, the rosary as\r\n",
      "convenient to my hand as to his, and as the vehicle swayed our heads\r\n",
      "dodged each other as we rocked back and forth. Thrown thus, as it were\r\n",
      "into the embrace of the past, I made the most of it and got as far\r\n",
      "as might be into the mediaeval. I found my friar charmingly\r\n",
      "companionable. His Bavarian _patois_ was not easy to follow, nor\r\n",
      "could he catch readily the speech I had been learning in the schools.\r\n",
      "But we made shift and had much talk as we drove through the storm\r\n",
      "into the highlands. He was a brother in the monastery at Salzburg,\r\n",
      "but being out of health, was making his way to a hospice of his order\r\n",
      "above the valley. He had heard of America, and knew there were houses\r\n",
      "of his order in that strange land. He was doubtful of its location,\r\n",
      "and possibly an American was a creature with whom he had never till\r\n",
      "then been in touch. Under the scrutiny of his mild eyes I was being\r\n",
      "studied as a queer outlandish specimen, as he certainly was to me. We\r\n",
      "parted at last as good friends, his head now enveloped in the cowl,\r\n",
      "his sandals pattering off in the dusk toward the little cell that\r\n",
      "awaited him in the hospice, while I sought a place by the fire in the\r\n",
      "inn of Berchtesgaden. I learned afterward that he was well known and\r\n",
      "much venerated in Salzburg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I came into the mountain-nook oddly companioned, and my exit thence\r\n",
      "was equally so, though greatly in contrast. For a day or two I was\r\n",
      "storm-bound, and felt the depression natural in a remote solitude,\r\n",
      "wrapped in by rain and fog, with no society but an unintelligible\r\n",
      "mountaineer or two. At last it cleared and the revulsion was\r\n",
      "inspiring. I found myself in a little green vale hemmed in\r\n",
      "by magnificent heights whose rocky summits were covered with\r\n",
      "freshly-fallen snow. Close at hand rose the Watzmann, a soaring\r\n",
      "pyramid whose summit was cleft into two sharp peaks inclined into some\r\n",
      "semblance of a bishop's mitre. My recent association with the monk had\r\n",
      "made vivid the thought of the old church, and it seemed fitting that\r\n",
      "there should be lifted high in air such a symbol of the domination\r\n",
      "under which the region lay. But my Protestant eyes regarded it\r\n",
      "cheerfully, glad to have within range an object so picturesque. I\r\n",
      "forthwith strapped on my knapsack, buckled my belt, and strode out for\r\n",
      "the Königs-See, which lay not far beyond. I walked briskly for a mile\r\n",
      "or two, stimulated by the abounding oxygen of the highland air, but\r\n",
      "presently found myself where the road forked and there was nothing to\r\n",
      "indicate which was my right path. The solitude seemed complete, but as\r\n",
      "I stood hesitating, I was relieved by the appearance of a pedestrian\r\n",
      "who emerged from a by-way. As I framed an inquiry I was deterred by a\r\n",
      "certain augustness in the stranger. I had rarely seen a man of finer\r\n",
      "bearing. His stature was commanding, his figure, even in the rough,\r\n",
      "loose walking-dress he wore, was full of symmetry. His elastic step\r\n",
      "showed vigour, and his face under his broad-brimmed Tyrolese hat had\r\n",
      "much manly beauty. Was he perhaps a prince in disguise? His friendly\r\n",
      "salutation, given in deep masculine tones with a good-natured smile,\r\n",
      "put me at ease as I told him my strait. He said in good German, which\r\n",
      "I was glad once more to hear after my experience of the mountain\r\n",
      "_patois_, that he was on the way to the Königs-See, that he knew\r\n",
      "the road, and we would walk on together. I accommodated myself to his\r\n",
      "stride and we settled into a pace which carried us rapidly toward\r\n",
      "our goal, meanwhile talking cheerfully. I had found it usually a good\r\n",
      "passport to say I was an American and I withheld nothing as to my\r\n",
      "antecedents and my present errand in Germany. He was more reticent.\r\n",
      "He lived in Prussia and was at the moment taking an outing. His\r\n",
      "affability did not go the length of revealing his true character. If\r\n",
      "he were a high personage _incognito_, I was not to know it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We reached at last the shore of the Königs-See, a blue, deep lake at\r\n",
      "a high elevation, encircled by lofty peaks, splintered, storm-beaten,\r\n",
      "and capped by snow which never melts, far above the range of grass and\r\n",
      "trees. A group of women on the beach had ready two or three broad and\r\n",
      "rudely-built boats, and noisily clamoured for our patronage. We\r\n",
      "chose what seemed the best, and the women rowers with stout arms soon\r\n",
      "propelled us far from shore into the midst of the Alpine sublimity. A\r\n",
      "silence fell, broken only by the oar-beats. Then, where the precipices\r\n",
      "rose highest we paused. Suddenly a gun was fired. It broke upon\r\n",
      "the silence startlingly loud, and after an interval the report\r\n",
      "reverberated in a series of crashes from height after height, dying\r\n",
      "down into a dull murmur from the steep most distant. I was awed by the\r\n",
      "sight and the sound, and awed too, by my companion. He had thrown off\r\n",
      "his hat and knapsack and stood with his fine stature at the bow. His\r\n",
      "classic face was turned upward to the peaks, and with a look as if he\r\n",
      "felt their power. He waved his arms toward them as if in a salutation\r\n",
      "to things sentient. The man seemed to befit the environment, majestic\r\n",
      "though it was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We returned sooner than we desired from our excursion on the water,\r\n",
      "the boat-women being over eager for new passengers. My companion\r\n",
      "resumed his knapsack and it was time to part. To his question as to\r\n",
      "my plan I replied that I was there simply for the scenery, that I\r\n",
      "purposed to make my way back to Salzburg on foot by the paths that\r\n",
      "promised most, and should be guided by whatever I might learn. He said\r\n",
      "that he, too, was bound for Salzburg, walking for pleasure; and when I\r\n",
      "thereupon suggested that we might go on together, he readily fell in,\r\n",
      "and we trudged forward. Comradeship grew strong as the day passed,\r\n",
      "then a night in an unfrequented inn, then another day. We discussed\r\n",
      "things near and far, ancient and recent, I talking most but he was\r\n",
      "always genial and quietly responsive, and my confidence was invited.\r\n",
      "I told him of the little fresh-water college in the West with which\r\n",
      "I was associated, my functions being partly pedagogic and partly\r\n",
      "pastoral, of the embarrassments of co-education as we found them, the\r\n",
      "difficulty in the uplift of too frivolous youth to a high moral and\r\n",
      "spiritual plane, the embarrassment in curbing characters too reckless\r\n",
      "into decorum and propriety. He listened sympathetically, with no\r\n",
      "discoverable cynicism in the rather grave smile he usually wore. As to\r\n",
      "whom he might be, he remained constantly reticent, though my curiosity\r\n",
      "increased as the hours flew. We passed not far from two or three\r\n",
      "mountain resorts, where tourists were gathered. Near such my companion\r\n",
      "showed some nervousness. There might be people there who knew him, and\r\n",
      "it suited him for the time to remain by himself. This I took as some\r\n",
      "small confirmation of my suspicion that he was a great personage.\r\n",
      "Physically certainly he was superbly endowed. The roads were rough and\r\n",
      "often steep, and I found the tramp fatiguing; but when I asked if he,\r\n",
      "too, were not tired, he laughed at the idea, tossing his burden or\r\n",
      "taking an extra climb as fresh as at the start. At night our cots were\r\n",
      "in the same room. As he stripped off his shirt and stood with head\r\n",
      "pillared upon a most stately neck, and massive, well-moulded chest and\r\n",
      "shoulders, he was statuesque indeed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last Salzburg came in sight. Though we had become quite intimate I\r\n",
      "had made no progress in penetrating to my comrade's true character.\r\n",
      "I had laid many an innocent little trap to induce him to speak more\r\n",
      "openly, but no slip on his part ever betrayed him. We entered the city\r\n",
      "and sat down together at a table in a public garden, near the castle\r\n",
      "of the old Bishops of Salzburg, ordering for each a glass of light\r\n",
      "wine, the parting-cup. Already, since our entrance into the city\r\n",
      "things had occurred which partly confirmed the theory I had formed as\r\n",
      "to the distinction of my comrade, and also aroused in my mind\r\n",
      "doubts not quite comfortable. He was an object of interest in the\r\n",
      "well-dressed crowd. That he was a conspicuously handsome man in\r\n",
      "a measure explained that, but there were signs, too, that some\r\n",
      "recognised him as a person well-known. When we were seated in the\r\n",
      "garden actual acquaintances began to appear, agile athletic young\r\n",
      "men, who were deferential but familiar. There were ladies, too, modest\r\n",
      "enough, but certainly unconventional, nimble free-footed beings, with\r\n",
      "feathers and ribbons streaming airily as they flitted. These, like the\r\n",
      "men, were deferential to my comrade, yet familiar. There seemed to be\r\n",
      "a renewing of some old tie that all were glad to reconnect. The young\r\n",
      "men were actively demonstrative, the ladies wove in and out smilingly,\r\n",
      "and my comrade in the midst beamed and grew voluble. Was it an\r\n",
      "environment into which a quiet American college functionary could\r\n",
      "properly fit? No due bounds were transgressed, but the atmosphere was\r\n",
      "certainly very Bohemian. My prince _incognito_, was he perhaps\r\n",
      "the Prince of Pilsen? While this happy mingling was going forward\r\n",
      "I sat somewhat aloof, disconcerted that my cloud-capped towers and\r\n",
      "gorgeous palaces were thus crumbling into comic opera. But now my\r\n",
      "comrade approached me, aglow with social excitement, and, with a\r\n",
      "franker look in his eyes than he had before shown, addressed me: \"Mein\r\n",
      "lieber Herr Professor, we have had a good ramble together and talked\r\n",
      "about many things. You have been confidential with me, and hoped that\r\n",
      "I would be with you. I have preferred to hold back, but now as we part\r\n",
      "I ought to tell you who I am. I am the _prémier danseur_ in the\r\n",
      "ballet of the Royal Opera House in Berlin. Worn with the heavy work in\r\n",
      "_Fantasca_, which we produced elaborately and which ran long,\r\n",
      "I came down here when the season closed, for change and rest,\r\n",
      "and so fell in with you. These young _Herren_ and _Damen_ are\r\n",
      "the _coryphés_ and _figurantes_, who in Berlin or in other\r\n",
      "cities have taken part with me in productions. Good people they are\r\n",
      "and unsurpassed as a _corps de ballet_.\" We touched glasses,\r\n",
      "shook hands, and I went my way leaving Comus with his rout, guileless,\r\n",
      "I hope, as Milton's innocent \"Lady,\" but such scales never fell from\r\n",
      "her starry eyes as fell from mine. I knew well about _Fantasca_.\r\n",
      "During my last weeks in Berlin it had been much talked about, a\r\n",
      "splendid theatrical spectacle put on with consummate art, and\r\n",
      "lavish expenditure. I had not seen it. Heredity from eight Puritan\r\n",
      "generations reinforced by impecuniosity had kept me from that. But I\r\n",
      "had heard of the wonderful visions of beauty and grace. My handsome\r\n",
      "comrade of the Bavarian Alps had been at the centre of it all, the god\r\n",
      "Apollo, or whatever glittering divinity or genius it was that swayed\r\n",
      "the enchantments and led in the rhythmic circlings. Good cause indeed\r\n",
      "I had had to admire his physical beauty. He had been picked out for\r\n",
      "that no doubt among thousands, then painfully trained for years until\r\n",
      "in figure and frame he was a model.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The gay pleasure garden in which we had parted lay close to a gloomy\r\n",
      "monastic structure, centuries old, that from a height dominated the\r\n",
      "little town. The garden and the structure were symbols of what was\r\n",
      "most salient in that country--the ancient church braced against\r\n",
      "progress, with its power broken in no way, and on the other hand of\r\n",
      "a life interpenetrated with things graceful and refined, with art,\r\n",
      "music, and poetry, but seamed, too, with frivolity and what makes\r\n",
      "for the pleasures of sense. My two friends also were in their way\r\n",
      "types,--the cowled Franciscan, aloof in a mediaeval seclusion though\r\n",
      "he breathed nineteenth-century air, and the dancer whom I encountered\r\n",
      "in the vale, above which the Watzmann upholds forever its solemn\r\n",
      "mitre. But they were good fellows both, my comrade in and my comrade\r\n",
      "out. The monk's heart was not too shrivelled to flow with human\r\n",
      "kindness, and the dancer had not unlearned in the glare of the\r\n",

      "of Mahone's command, and hiring an excellent roadster, we drove on\r\n",
      "a perfect autumn day first to Spottsylvania Court House, then across\r\n",
      "country to the Brock road, then home by the Wilderness church and\r\n",
      "Chancellorsville. On the area we traversed were fought four of our\r\n",
      "most memorable battles, an area now scarcely less tangled and lonely\r\n",
      "than when the Federals poured across the Rappahannock into its\r\n",
      "thickets by the thousand, and were so memorably met. My veteran knew\r\n",
      "the pikes and the by-paths, and we fraternised with the warmth usual\r\n",
      "among foemen who at last have become friends. He knew the story well\r\n",
      "of every wood-path and cross-roads. Certainly I was glad that the\r\n",
      "rugged acres had undergone no \"improvement,\" and that the eye fell\r\n",
      "so nearly on what the old-time soldiers saw. It so happened it\r\n",
      "was election-day. There were polling-places at the court-houses of\r\n",
      "Fredericksburg and Spottsylvania, at Todd's Tavern, and the Chancellor\r\n",
      "house, names bearing solemn associations. The neighbourhoods had come\r\n",
      "out to vote, and introduced by my comrade, I had some interesting\r\n",
      "encounters. It was a good climax, when toward the end, near\r\n",
      "the Chancellor House, we met in the road a patriarchal figure,\r\n",
      "whitebearded and sturdy, on his way home from the polls. It was old\r\n",
      "Talley, whose log-house, in 1862, was the point from which Stonewall\r\n",
      "Jackson began his sudden rush upon Hooker's right. Talley, then a\r\n",
      "young farmer, had walked at the General's stirrup pointing out the\r\n",
      "way. He had interesting things to tell of Stonewall Jackson at that\r\n",
      "moment when his career culminated. \"What did he seem like?\" I queried.\r\n",
      "\"He was as cool and business-like as an old farmer looking after\r\n",
      "his fences.\" On an old battle-field which had been illustrated by an\r\n",
      "achievement of the Stonewall division especially brilliant, I chanced\r\n",
      "to meet a grey veteran who had taken part in it, a North Carolinian\r\n",
      "who had come back to review the scene. We fraternised, of course.\r\n",
      "\"What did Stonewall Jackson look like?\" I said. Stepping close to\r\n",
      "me, the \"Tarheel\" extended his two gnarled forefingers, and pressed\r\n",
      "between the tips my cheek-bones on either side. \"He had the broadest\r\n",

      "to Lexington, where repose in honoured graves two such protagonists as\r\n",
      "Lee and Stonewall Jackson. It is a beautiful town among low mountains\r\n",
      "green to the summit, and in the streets not a few lovely homes of the\r\n",
      "Virginia colonial type, draped with ivy and wisteria. There stand the\r\n",
      "buildings of Washington and Lee University, in the chapel of which\r\n",
      "lies buried Robert E. Lee, and a short mile beyond is the Virginia\r\n",
      "Military Institute, from which Stonewall Jackson went forth to his\r\n",
      "fame. The memorial at Jackson's grave is appropriate, a figure in\r\n",
      "bronze, rugged as he was in face and attire, the image of him as he\r\n",
      "fought and fell. Different, but more impressive is the memorial of\r\n",
      "Lee. You enter through the chapel where the students gather daily,\r\n",
      "then passing the chancel, stand in a mausoleum, where nobly conceived\r\n",
      "in marble the soldier lies as if asleep. He bears his symbols as\r\n",
      "champion in chief of the \"Lost Cause,\" but the light on his face is\r\n",
      "not that of battle. It is serene, benignant, at peace. I was deeply\r\n",
      "moved as I stood before it, but soon after I was to experience a\r\n",
      "deeper thrill. The afternoon was waning when I walked on to the\r\n",
      "Military Institute. Stonewall Jackson had been for ten years a teacher\r\n",
      "there. The turf of the parade I was crossing had perhaps felt no\r\n",
      "footfall more often than his. Two or three hundred pupils, the flower\r\n",
      "of Virginia youth, were assembled in battalion, and I witnessed from\r\n",
      "a favourable point their almost perfect drill. As the sun was about to\r\n",
      "set, they formed in a far-extending line, with each piece at present.\r\n",
      "They were saluting the flag, which now began slowly to descend from,\r\n",
      "its staff. Lo, it was the flag of the Union. The band played, I\r\n",
      "thought, with unusual sweetness, the Star-Spangled Banner, and to\r\n",
      "the music those picked youths of the South, sons and grandsons of the\r\n",
      "upholders of the right to sever, did all possible honour, on the sod\r\n",
      "which Stonewall Jackson trod, hard by the grave of Lee, to the symbol\r\n",
      "of a country united, states now and hereafter in a brotherhood not to\r\n",
      "be broken! It was a scene to evoke tears of deep emotion, for never\r\n",
      "before or since has it come home to me so powerfully that the Union\r\n",
      "had been preserved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Closing as I do now my record of memories, I feel that the most\r\n",
      "momentous of the crises through which it has been my lot to pass\r\n",
      "is that attending the maintenance of the Federal bond in the United\r\n",
      "States. Assemblies of veterans of the Confederacy and those who\r\n",
      "address them scout the idea that they fought to preserve negro\r\n",
      "bondage. A late historian of our Civil War, Professor Paxon, of\r\n",
      "Wisconsin, holds it to be \"reasonably certain\" that in another\r\n",
      "generation slavery would have disappeared of itself, a contention\r\n",
      "surely open to dispute. Here I neither dispute nor approve, but\r\n",
      "only say, if the claim can be made good, what a vindication would it\r\n",
      "constitute of men, who looked for the quiet dying out of an inveterate\r\n",
      "evil, deprecating passionate attack upon a thing moribund? And what an\r\n",
      "indictment of the John Browns, whose impatient consciences pressed\r\n",
      "for instant abolition careless of whatever cataclysm it might involve!\r\n",
      "Certainly the two prime champions whose graves I saw at Lexington did\r\n",
      "not fight to sustain slavery. Their principle was that a State could\r\n",
      "not be coerced,--and that therefore sovereignty lay in the scattered\r\n",
      "constituents and not at the centre. The arbitrament of the sword was\r\n",
      "sharp and swift, and happily for the world it went against them. I\r\n",
      "well recall the map of Germany I studied when a boy, a page blotched\r\n",
      "and seamed with bewildering spots of colour. The effort was to portray\r\n",
      "the position of some three hundred independent political units,\r\n",
      "duchies, principalities, bishoprics, free cities, and what not, among\r\n",
      "electorates and kingdoms of a larger sort, but still minute. It\r\n",
      "seemed like a pathological chart presenting a face broken out with an\r\n",
      "unseemly tetter. The land indeed, in those days, was afflicted by a\r\n",
      "sad political disease. The Germans call it \"_Particularismus_\" or\r\n",
      "\"_Vielstaaterei_,\" the breaking up of a nationality into a mass\r\n",
      "of fragments. Some on the map were scarcely larger than pinheads, and\r\n",
      "in actual area hardly exceeded a fair-sized farm. In that time Heine\r\n",
      "laughed at one of them after this fashion, while describing a journey\r\n",

      "oppressively administered, without associations to awaken pride, or\r\n",
      "generous interests to evoke devotion. Spirits like Leasing and Goethe,\r\n",
      "all but derided patriotism. It scarcely held a place among the proper\r\n",
      "virtues. The small units were forever unsympathetic and inharmonious,\r\n",

      "scarcely more than nominal, of the weakest and coolest. In 1787\r\n",
      "came the beneficent change. The thirteen and those that followed the\r\n",
